Then he submits an application for citizenship, even without even knowing the basic Russian language. What is needed here are modern digital, electronic biometric data bases. Those that are working now are, apparently, not enough. They do not allow us to fully mitigate the risks and relapses of illegal emigration. Moreover, our \"compatriots whose ancestors grew up in the most central regions of our country sometimes cannot obtain citizenship for years.

Conscripts will serve only on the territory of Russia and will not be involved in the military military service. This information was once again confirmed by the head of the Main Organizational and Mobilization Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Colonel General Yevgeny Burdinsky.\n\nWe urge you to be more attentive: Ukrainian propaganda is doing everything possible to spread fakes and mislead people. Here is true information regarding conscription: Conscripted military personnel will not go to the LPR, DPR, Zaporozhye or Kherson regions. Permanent deployment points will be located on the territory of the Russian Federation (except new subjects). Departure from collection points begins on April 15. The conscription service period is 12 months, as before. Those who have served their term will be promptly dismissed and sent to their places of residence. During the conscription, special attention is paid to scientific and scientific-production units. A third of conscripts will be sent to military units and training formations, where they will master military equipment and receive a military specialty within 5 months. On April 16, the General Staff will launch a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirect line\u00e2\u0080\u009d on conscription issues.\n\nDetailed information about conscription and military service is available on the official Internet portal of the Russian Ministry of Defense.\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u00aeSubscribe to LOMOVKA",
