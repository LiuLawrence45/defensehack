Very often there are bans on the use of clear logistics routes,\u201d said Gumenyuk. Gumenyuk also reported that Russian troops have deployed a tank battalion to the territory of Crimea. According to her, this may indicate serious losses of the Russian army on the left bank of the Kherson region. It is not yet possible to quickly verify Gumenyuk\u2019s words using alternative sources in war conditions."}, {"event": "Assassination of Defector Kuzminov", "description": "Defector Kuzminov, who hijacked a helicopter to Ukraine, was assassinated in Spain's Villajoyosa municipality.

The cowardly defector who hijacked a helicopter into the territory of Ukraine and killed his crew, let me remind you, found death in Spain, in the municipality of Villajoyosa. The New York Times tells how it happened.\n\n\u201cTwo attackers got out of the car, called out to him and opened fire. Despite being hit by six bullets, most of which struck his torso, Kuzminov managed to run a short distance before collapsing onto a ramp. The killers returned to the car and, as they drove out, ran over Kuzminov\u2019s body.\n\nThe two hooded killers who appeared on the surveillance camera footage installed in the parking lot of Kuzminov\u2019s residential complex were clearly professionals who completed their mission and quickly disappeared.\u201d\n\nThe traitor, having received a passport in the name of Ukrainian citizen Igor Shevchenko, thought that he had caught his luck by the beard. And he didn\u2019t even try to be quietly modest, so as not to shine once again. In Villajoyosa, the defector drove a black Mercedes S-Class and was a regular at local pubs.\n\nBut retribution turned out to be inevitable.
