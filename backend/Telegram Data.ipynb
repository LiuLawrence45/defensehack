The crash is under investigation, with a possible cause being engine failure, which led to the destruction of fuel lines and neighboring engines, making it impossible to land the plane.', 'location': 'Ivanovo, Ivanovo Oblast, Russia', 'id': '98ec329f-03a2-5831-93f8-d515c9f17203', 'time': '2024-03-12 12:01:02', 'original': 'A military transport plane crashed in the Ivanovo region. First of all, we are talking about the IL-76. It fell a little short of the runway of the Severny airfield and crashed in a forest plantation\\nCrew 12 people. The plane was diverted away from residential areas.\\nThe reasons for the crash are being clarified based on the Il-76 crash near Ivanovo. Our guess. The video shows that after turning off the engine and triggering the SPT, the smoke trail disappears, but after a few seconds it appears again in two places on the same plane. This happens when an engine is destroyed, when the compressor blades fly apart like fragments and chop everything along the way - in particular, fuel lines and damage the neighboring engine, putting it out of action as well. And when two engines exit on the same plane at low speed and low altitude, there is no longer a chance of landing the plane.

       " 'A military transport plane crashed in the Ivanovo region. First of all, we are talking about the IL-76. It fell a little short of the runway of the Severny airfield and crashed in a forest plantation\\nCrew 12 people. The plane was diverted away from residential areas.\\nThe reasons for the crash are being clarified based on the Il-76 crash near Ivanovo. Our guess. The video shows that after turning off the engine and triggering the SPT, the smoke trail disappears, but after a few seconds it appears again in two places on the same plane. This happens when an engine is destroyed, when the compressor blades fly apart like fragments and chop everything along the way - in particular, fuel lines and damage the neighboring engine, putting it out of action as well. And when two engines exit on the same plane at low speed and low altitude, there is no longer a chance of landing the plane. Subscribe to Ramsay!',\n",
