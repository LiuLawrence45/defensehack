      "Ukraine began to receive more ammunition for the German Gepard air defense systems - source BILDIn the summer, BILD reported that Germany did not have enough ammunition for the Gepard anti-aircraft self-propelled guns. Due to the shortage, Ukrainian anti-aircraft gunners were forced to save them. Soon the German Ministry of Defense announced that they were increasing supplies. Recently, in a conversation with BILD, an Ukrainian Armed Forces officer confirmed that the supply of ammunition to the Cheetahs had indeed improved somewhat.This is especially important now, as Russia has stepped up its attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure. For example, it attacked the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station and the Zmievskaya Thermal Power Plant near Kharkov. Cheetahs performed particularly well in the fight against Iranian Shaheed drones. But their range is limited, so they do not help against missiles. For this purpose, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are armed with the Soviet S-300 complexes, as well as the Western Patriot, IRIS-T, SAMP/T and NASAMS. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry calls for more air defense systems to be supplied to the country, especially Patriot.\n",

      "We consider it necessary to critically comment on Aitech Bizhev‚Äôs speech. Of course, today our air attack weapons dominate the battlefield and the Ukrainian air defense system cannot cope with them, but underestimating it is a very dangerous mistake.In addition, there are a number of controversial points in the ex-commander‚Äôs speech. And the first of them is the technical backwardness of the Ukrainian air defense system. Let us quote General Bizhev: ‚Äú...I note that the transfer of information is carried out manually, since Western ‚ÄúPatriots‚Äù are not integrated into the automated Ukrainian air defense system...‚Äù. This is, to put it mildly, not true!Ukrainian air defense has been integrated into the unified NATO air defense system in Europe for more than a year now, and it is the information capabilities of European air defense that are the basis for the functioning of Ukrainian air defense. All Patriot, NASAMS, Iris-T air defense systems and the remaining Ukrainian S-300 and Buk M1 air defense systems are combined into a single combat circuit, based on high-speed automated control systems connected to NATO air defense automated control systems and receive information about the air situation from American and European radars, aircraft and AWACS UAVs, as well as satellites. That is why air raid alerts in Ukraine are most often announced immediately after the takeoff of our strike aircraft!Do the air defense systems available to the Armed Forces of Ukraine have the ability to shoot down our hypersonic missiles? You must understand that under certain conditions, any target can be shot down. Suffice it to recall how, literally on the second day of the NATO air war against the SFRY, the Yugoslav S-125 air defense system shot down a B-2 stealth bomber. Therefore, the question must be posed differently: are the air defense systems available to the Ukrainian Armed Forces capable of becoming an effective weapon against Russian hypersonic missiles?The latest ERINT missile defense system for the Patriot air defense system is capable of intercepting targets moving along a ballistic trajectory at a speed of 1600 m/s - 5760 km/h, but provided that the target does not maneuver.At the same time, our hypersonic ‚ÄúDagger‚Äù has a maximum speed when flying to a target - Mach 10-12 (Mach 1 is conventionally equal to the speed of sound, that is, 340 m/s or 1224 km/h). It would seem - there are no options! But the fact is that in dense layers of air near the ground, its speed decreases somewhat, and if accurate advance information is received about the moment of missile launch, launch parameters and the direction from which the missile is approaching, the latest modification of the Patriot has a chance of intercepting it. American air defense systems are not capable of shooting down missiles of the Zircon family. But here we come to the second question: is today‚Äôs Ukrainian air defense an effective system for countering Russian ‚Äúhypersonics‚Äù and here the answer is unequivocal - no! \"Patriots\" are only capable of occasionally intercepting such targets, but are unable to cover targets and protect themselves. To do this, Ukrainian air defense needs to be increased by an order of magnitude! Increase its density by at least three to five times. But even then, the percentage of hypersonic targets shot down will not exceed 50%, and even then, such as the Kinzhal. And it can be assumed that the West and the United States will soon increase supplies of air defense systems to the Zelensky regime. https://mk-ru.turbopages.org/turbo/mk.ru/s/politics/2024/03/30/general-bizhev- rasskazal-sposobna-li-ukrainskaya-pvo-sbit-rossiyskiy-cirkon.htmlRAMZAYMoskovsky Komsomolets (MK)General Bizhev told whether Ukrainian air defense is capable of shooting down the Russian Zircon\"All statements about the interception of these missiles are from the evil one\" One of the most discussed events last week - the use of Russian hypersonic cancer...\n",

      "‚ùóÔ∏èRussian troops have intensified shelling of the mainland of Ukraine from the territory of occupied Crimea. Speaker of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army ‚ÄúSouth‚Äù Sergei Bratchuk spoke about this. ‚ÄúThis is due to the fact that temporarily occupied Crimea, as a military hub, is saturated with weapons and air defense systems. The Ukrainian Defense Forces are managing to penetrate these air defense systems, and the intensity of our strikes will increase. But here there are questions for our allies and partners: where are the long-range missiles that should help us in the demilitarization of Crimea?‚Äù Bratchuk said. There is a direct threat of ballistic missile strikes from the Russian troops located in Crimea.‚ÄúBallistics‚Äù are practically not knocked down, except by complexes that we lack today - these are the American Patriot (‚ÄúPatriot‚Äù) and the French-Italian SAMP/T air defense systems. We are not talking about one launcher; an integrated approach is needed in their supply to Ukraine. That is, not one battery, but several batteries. If we resolve this issue, then we will protect our sky. Therefore, I hope that in the near future the enemy‚Äôs ‚Äúballistics‚Äù will be disrupted,‚Äù the speaker emphasized.Bratchuk recalled that Crimea is not such a large territory for modern weapons, and the Ukrainian Defense Forces can reach almost any military facility of the occupiers on the peninsula.‚ÄúToday it is not safe for the occupiers to be on the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea, because today there is not a single location that cannot be reached by the fire weapons of the Ukrainian Defense Forces. Yes, we would like the destruction to take place more actively - several ballistics launchers, for example, the same S-300 or Bastions, so that planes, ships, command posts and so on are destroyed. But this is a big and difficult job,‚Äù he continued. YouTube The Ukrainian Armed Forces will reach Russians everywhere. Ukrainian missiles reach their targetsRussian occupiers in the southern direction do not stop attacking with missiles and kamikaze drones.

When launching a missile defense system, when you press the ‚Äústart‚Äù and ‚Äúlaunch blocking‚Äù keys, the request ‚Äúfriend/foe‚Äù automatically occurs, and if God forbid, ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, then the launch is blocked!

      "300 Forwarded from: ColonelcassadThe first attack of assault drones in history. In Berdychi, which is now being liberated by Russian troops, a new promising Russian robotic platform was field tested.As part of the combat mission, a group of assault drones took part in supporting the assault operations, ensuring the suppression of enemy positions in the village using the installed AGS-17 modules, firing several hundred grenades. During combat use, drones showed good results. The drones were able to continue operating even in conditions where losses of personnel and expensive equipment from enemy fire would have been inevitable.The experience gained in combat use will be taken into account in the further production and development of assault robotic platforms. The combat use of such drones in Berdychi is actually similar to the first tank attack during the First World War.A successful tracked base has great potential for developing a robotic platform for assault (installation of various combat modules) and support operations (transportation and installation of mines, removal of the wounded, transportation of cargo and equipment).In the future, such platforms will take their place on the battlefield. Despite the fact that there are similar developments in the USA, Britain and China, it was Russia that was the first to use a group of assault drones in a real war.The project is being implemented with the support of Boris Rozhin and Chingis Dambiev.
