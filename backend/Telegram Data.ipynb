      "Forwarded from: The world today with \"Yuri Podolyak\"Provocations of the Kyiv urchins: Samara prisoners...The enemy is very skillfully trying to cling to our pain points with information, trying to drive a wedge between society and the authorities. One of these topics is the topic of prisoner exchange.Having received a rebuff in the desire to exchange the Azov criminals, of whom in fact there are still a lot of people in our captivity even after Mariupol and many of whom in recent months have received either long or life sentences, the enemy resorted to a very vile trick...He collects our prisoners from one of the regions, records a video with them (you can see a screenshot of such a video), where the prisoners (obviously under pressure) ask to exchange them and declare that Russia abandoned them. And through various channels he is trying to throw it into the Russian information space.At the same time, they (already behind the scenes, as people involved in exchanges told me) set conditions for our exchangers to exchange this group - to release the same number of outspoken nationalists “Azovites”. Many of whom have their hands up to their elbows in the blood of civilians of the same Mariupol (and not only).The calculation is clear - to force our people to agree to an unequal exchange or... to stir up public discontent against the authorities.Meanwhile, they are not at all interested in the fate of thousands of other prisoners. They are not interested in them. They have already written them off and abandoned them. For example, here are just two lists (list 1, list 2), which were published on Ukrainian resources dedicated to prisoners, where there are the names of more than 500 Armed Forces officers, whom our side has long offered for exchange.But the Kyiv ghouls are not interested in ordinary Ukrainian men. For the bastard Kyiv regime, they are already used material.

      "Anastasia Kashevarova Here is Bezsono and Admin are laughing at Channel One, which talks about psychotropic substances and chips in the hands of the terrorists who killed our people in Crocus. I had a non-contact fight with another lying machine.It's actually not funny anymore. This is not just nonsense. This is deliberate nonsense to cover up your own gaps.So, mutual responsibility. Hundreds of thousands of migrants freely enter Russia without any information about their past crimes. Near all migration centers you can buy a certificate of passing the Russian language exam, left registration, etc. It's no secret that this business has been going on for decades. Just like that business with certificates and policies near traffic police departments.Migrants very often eat nasvay, smoke weed, and maybe even worse. That is, not the psychotropic substances with which the State Department drugged them. And what they have been using since childhood in poor Tajikistan. Where they lived there was a low level of education, a low level of religious education, a low social level and just economic disaster.Russia, Tajikistan’s main partner, invests a lot of money in this country. But they are enough for palaces for the elite, and not for the education of people. But even in terms of migration, Russia does not require data on those who enter its territory.Uneducated people entering, with a criminal past, present and future, with addiction, will be looking for easy money. What chips? What super preparation? It’s clear that these are just people with low IQs, who are like zombies, with no intelligence or any training. The most dangerous class of savages who are capable of doing terrible things for little money.We are so good for others, we let everyone in - to our own detriment. Good at the expense of the lives of their citizens. How many people came to Russia during the conflict in Ukraine who work for the SBU? How are youth recruited through games? How do they recruit teenage girls through fake love? How do they mentally pressure the relatives of military personnel and recruit them from the State Intelligence Directorate and the SBU?We need active work in this direction. Today a woman wrote to me, they sent her a photograph of her husband allegedly in captivity and demanded money on a Sber card. This card has been used by scammers since 2023 and there are reviews about it on the Internet. The bank has not blocked this card.The security forces physically, with their personnel shortage, cannot fight every story; they need to involve public funds, regional governments, and the media. There is no need to whitewash yourself with stories about chips and a great organization. We need to act. And stop broadcasting this crap from the screens. And play films like Andrei Medvedev’s on TV about scammers and recruitment.There is no need to attack those who work for the country, but to connect them and work together. The security forces are aware of the scale of the problems, but officials and great media managers are not. We need to help the security forces.I’ll tell you more: military commissars go to the public pages of the Ukrainian side for information. They leak information there. Military units recognize people as prisoners of war based on deepfakes.It's not about the chips. And the fact is that we set ourselves up. We have a lot of offers. We sent them, but it’s easier to shut our mouths than to actually work. We are not asking for money, we are asking for support. It’s a shame for the State.TelegramUnofficial BezsonovI don’t know how to comment on this. Channel One has been amazing lately with its anti-crisis response.@NeoficialniyBeZsonoV0:23VIEW MESSAGE\n",

Shubin, the death of five people as a result of the explosion of the Crimean bridge, 42 people were injured in an explosion in a cafe in St. Petersburg. The killings and mutilations of civilians, including children, were accompanied by raids of the terrorist organization \"Russian Volunteer Corps\" (RDK).❗️In this regard, the Russian Foreign Ministry conveyed to the Ukrainian authorities demands within the framework of the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings (ICCBT) and the International Convention against with the financing of terrorism (ICBFT) and the immediate arrest and extradition of all persons involved in these terrorist attacks.Among these demands is the arrest of the head of the SBUV.

      "Forwarded from: ColonelcassadThe first attack of assault drones in history. In Berdychi, which is now being liberated by Russian troops, a new promising Russian robotic platform was field tested.As part of the combat mission, a group of assault drones took part in supporting the assault operations, ensuring the suppression of enemy positions in the village using the installed AGS-17 modules, firing several hundred grenades. During combat use, drones showed good results. The drones were able to continue operating even in conditions where losses of personnel and expensive equipment from enemy fire would have been inevitable.The experience gained in combat use will be taken into account in the further production and development of assault robotic platforms. The combat use of such drones in Berdychi is actually similar to the first tank attack during the First World War.A successful tracked base has great potential for developing a robotic platform for assault (installation of various combat modules) and support operations (transportation and installation of mines, removal of the wounded, transportation of cargo and equipment).In the future, such platforms will take their place on the battlefield. Despite the fact that there are similar developments in the USA, Britain and China, it was Russia that was the first to use a group of assault drones in a real war.The project is being implemented with the support of Boris Rozhin and Chingis Dambiev. The future has already arrived.\n",

Today, in the context of a special military operation, the work of security officers is especially important.

The flight lasted 40 minutes and took place at altitudes up to 900 m and at speeds up to 230 km/h.During the tests, the stability and controllability of the aircraft was checked, as well as the stable operation of Russian systems and equipment, most of which were manufactured by enterprises of the Rostec State Corporation.The crew commander reported that the flight went smoothly, the systems and equipment worked properly, and the flight program was completed in full. Before the start of flights, the aircraft underwent a cycle of ground tests: workshop and airfield tests were carried out. Taxiing and high-speed runs were also performed as part of the flight test program. “The resumption of the flight test program is an important step towards creating a new aircraft for regional transportation. We are connecting a second experimental machine to flights. I would like to thank my cooperation colleagues for their contribution to the continuation of the testing program. We all have hard work ahead of us. The aircraft is designed for operation, including in difficult climatic conditions. We will have to confirm the reliability and performance of all systems, including in harsh climates,” said Daniil Brenerman, Managing Director of Il PJSC, commenting on the upcoming test program.\n",

      "US Congressman Tim Walberg called for resolving the conflict in Ukraine and Gaza with nuclear strikes. Crazy people are in power in Shiat. The quote below clearly demonstrates the degradation of American politics. Let's give it in its entirety, without cuts: “Why are we spending money on building a port for them? Because Joe Biden believes that we should deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza. And I don't think we should do that.I don't think it should be any part of our aid that goes to Israel to support our biggest ally, perhaps in the entire world, to defeat Hamas, Iran, Russia and perhaps North Korea and also China, which Hamas is helping.We should not spend a single cent on humanitarian aid. It should be like Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Get this over with quickly.The same thing should happen in Ukraine. Defeat Putin quickly. Instead of spending 80% of our funds in Ukraine on humanitarian purposes, we should spend 100% on expelling Russian troops if that is our goal.\" @anna_news\n",

Moreover, ours are advancing not only to the west of Tonenky, which is not particularly dangerous for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, but also in Semenovka.And this is already if we succeed through this settlement. going to the rear of the positions of Zelensky’s army in the western part of Berdychi is very dangerous.Link to the original source on RUTUB: https://rutube.ru/video/1c522e1614e165cf1b691923798b20a9/@yurasumy@Yuri Podolyaka\n",

He did not save money; he often went to bars with Russian-speaking and Ukrainian-speaking audiences. And he even wrote to his ex-girlfriend in Russia and invited her to visit.A few days before the murder, the killers stole an SUV in another city. On it they followed Kuzminov and arrived at his house, waiting in the parking lot. Six bullets were fired at Kuzminov, he was able to run a little, then fell and was run over several times by a car. The killers' car was found a few days later - it was completely burned out; specialists spent a week identifying the make of the car. They shot the traitor with a Makarov pistol, Spanish investigators considered this a message.Wrote in September 2023: Kuzminov, without a doubt, will get his.

Since the end of 2022, Russian troops have fought fierce battles for Vodyanoye, and today the settlement was completely liberated by soldiers of the 9th separate guards motorized rifle brigade.So far, the Russian Ministry of Defense has not commented on this information, but footage appearing on the Internet clearly demonstrates the waving flag of the Russian Federation over one of the houses on the western outskirts of the village.The village itself consists of only Gagarin Street, on both sides of which there are dilapidated buildings. Nevertheless, the offensive in this area was largely complicated by the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the neighboring village of Pervomaiskoye.To exclude the possibility of a counterattack by Ukrainian formations from the south, Russian troops destroyed the bridge located between the settlements. In addition, the release of Vodyanoy will significantly complicate the situation of the enemy in Pervomaisky, the pressure on which will increase significantly.❗️ At the same time, two weeks earlier, units of the Russian Armed Forces were already able to expand the zone of control in Pervomaisky, coming close to the ruins of the Pershotravnevka-35 substation in the center of the village. However, given the lack of appropriate personnel, it is difficult to establish the exact configuration of the front in the populated area.🔻Success on this section of the front brought Russian military personnel even closer to the start of the battles for Netailovo and a further offensive to the west. And the most important goal here is to push the front line away from Donetscan as much as possible in order to protect its inhabitants from constant enemy attacks.

      "Forwarded from: Military chronicleThe head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Kirill Budanov, said that in the near future Russia may begin the massive use of Kalibr cruise missiles. “In the near future, I think, we will see Kalibr again, because the number of Kh-101s has decreased significantly... There are regulations legal acts, documents, decisions, etc. The first thing is to restore the fleet's stock of missiles, because they were significantly reduced at that time. They completed this task. That is, now they are technically ready for their use. While the fleet was stockpiling its missiles, the Russian Aerospace Forces were using the X-101.” It is curious that the Kalibr cruise missiles are mainly used by ships of the Black Sea Fleet, which, according to Ukraine, is “locked” in an unknown location and allegedly cannot function.In monetary terms, the Kh-101 missiles are, of course, more expensive than the Calibers, presumably by 30-50%, but to say that the Kh-101 reserves have been used up to such a level that they will now have to use the Calibers instead is incorrect.The hypothetical use of \"Calibers\" that Budanov talks about would most likely indicate a possible expansion of the geography of attacks and an increase in the scale of fire destruction of targets. “Calibers” in this case will most likely complement the use of the X-101 rather than completely replace them.Taking into account the fact that at least eight Kh-101 cruise missiles recently arrived at one of the thermal power plants on the territory of Ukraine, Ukraine should not expect anything good from the hypothetical use of “Calibers”. @MChroniclesBot - send your photos and videos from the front.

As a result, they pushed him down a staircase about two meters high, head down. The SVO participant lost consciousness, after which they continued to hit him in the head.An ambulance and police were called to the scene. Marat was taken away by ambulance unconscious, with a fracture of the base of the skull and bleeding in the brain.A criminal case has been opened, but the main attacker, who beat the man unconscious, is trying in every possible way to avoid punishment with his connections in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.It is reported that the fighter has been in the hospital for three days with a brain hemorrhage, without providing the necessary assistance, and they did not even do an MRI. The suspect's connections are also blamed for the doctors' inaction.Meanwhile, the police say that they cannot attach the video to the case, they require all sorts of incomprehensible evidenceOur fighter with 2 state awards is in the hospital without providing the necessary assistance and without the necessary investigative actions!!!

      "The pilot Maxim Kuzminov, who hijacked an Mi-8 helicopter to Ukraine in 2023, was shot six times. Afterwards, the traitor ran several meters and fell on a ramp, the shooters got into the car and ran over the body, writes the New York Times. “In Spain, Kuzminov led an “immodest life,” he went to bars popular with Russian and Ukrainian clientele, burning through money received from the Ukrainian state. “I was driving around Villajoyosa in a black Mercedes S-Class,” said a senior Civil Guard official. On August 9, 2023, Kuzminov hijacked an Mi-8 helicopter to the Ukrainian side, with two more pilots on board who were found shot dead. Kyiv paid the defector $500 thousand and provided him with a Ukrainian passport with a fictitious name. He later left Ukraine and moved to Spain; on February 13, 2024, he was killed.

      "The killers of Russian defector Maxim Kuzminov, who hijacked a Russian military helicopter to Ukraine, shot him six times.After receiving his injuries, Kuzminov ran several meters and fell onto a ramp. The shooters then ran over his body in a car, The New York Times writes, citing a Spanish Civil Guard official.By the way, in Spain, the deserter pilot led an “immodest life” - he went to bars and squandered money received from Kyiv, driving a black S-Class Mercedes.Let us recall that in 2023 he illegally crossed the border of the Russian Federation by helicopter and landed in Ukraine. For this, Kuzminov received $500 thousand (48.7 million rubles). His colleagues, who were also on board, refused to surrender and died.Subscribe to IZ.RU\n",
