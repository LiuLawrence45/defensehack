      "🖼🎨Modern Art in the Middle East🔸To understand the origins of Arab modernism, it is important to return to the spirit of optimism that arose in the post-war era when, having gained independence from imperial masters, artists of the Middle East and North Africa began the search for a pan-Arab identity. Cultural movements such as the New Vision group in Iraq, led by the innovative artist Dia Al-Azzawi, championed the idea of an Arab modernism united on ideological grounds rather than style. Since 2003, the Middle Eastern market for works has been growing steadily: prices for paintings by artist Farah Al-Nissa Zeid reached £2.7 million in 2019. The opening of the Louvre Abu Dhabi, the success of the Arab Museum of Modern Art in Qatar and major exhibitions by artists such as Salua Rauda Shukair show that in the MENA region there is a great demand for art.🔸The big trend in the Middle East right now is women artists. There are many works being written to empower women. For example, Afifa Aleibi and Shirin Neshat are amazing artists who have become a springboard for the younger generation. In addition, the leading trend in contemporary art is socio-political motives. But one of the most important themes that continues to dominate the market is Arabic calligraphy. For many years, countries such as Egypt, Lebanon and Syria have been the leading producers of contemporary art in the Middle East.\n",
