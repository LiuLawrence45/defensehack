The video shows that after turning off the engine and triggering the SPT, the smoke trail disappears, but after a few seconds it appears again in two places on the same plane. This happens when an engine is destroyed, when the compressor blades fly apart like fragments and chop everything along the way - in particular, fuel lines and damage the neighboring engine, putting it out of action as well. And when two engines exit on the same plane at low speed and low altitude, there is no longer a chance of landing the plane.

The video shows that after turning off the engine and triggering the SPT, the smoke trail disappears, but after a few seconds it appears again in two places on the same plane. This happens when an engine is destroyed, when the compressor blades fly apart like fragments and chop everything along the way - in particular, fuel lines and damage the neighboring engine, putting it out of action as well. And when two engines exit on the same plane at low speed and low altitude, there is no longer a chance of landing the plane.

The video shows that after turning off the engine and triggering the SPT, the smoke trail disappears, but after a few seconds it appears again in two places on the same plane. This happens when an engine is destroyed, when the compressor blades fly apart like fragments and chop everything along the way - in particular, fuel lines and damage the neighboring engine, putting it out of action as well. And when two engines exit on the same plane at low speed and low altitude, there is no longer a chance of landing the plane.
