The famous Foreign Campaign of the Russian Army was, in fact, a large-scale operation to liberate Europe from Napoleonic troops: it took place over a space of hundreds of kilometers between the Baltic Sea and Brest-Litovsk, the Neman and the Rhine.\n\nRussian troops gave freedom to dozens of European cities, including such large ones as Berlin and Amsterdam. And Russia received new heroes - Mikhail Barclay de Tolly, Leonty Korenny and Alexander Benkendorf.\n\nAfter the capture of Paris, France capitulated and Napoleon abdicated power. His army conquered all of Europe, but was defeated in Russia in 1812.\n\nAt the entrance to Paris, the Russian cavalcade was led by horse guards and Cossacks, followed by hussars and cuirassiers of the Prussian Guard, then dragoons and hussars of the Russian Guard rode.\n\nAs they moved towards the city center, the mood of the wary public changed: Parisians, who were expecting imminent reprisals for Moscow devastated in 1812, saw that the conquerors were behaving with restraint and friendliness. The crowd began to hear greetings addressed to the Russian Emperor. And when Alexander I was surrounded by a crowd at the Champs Elysees, he heard: \u201cWe have been waiting for the arrival of Your Majesty for a long time!\u201d\n\nDuring his stay in Paris, the emperor issued strict instructions not to offend peaceful Frenchmen and, in general, to behave with dignity and not to rob. This was especially surprising compared to how barbarically the French behaved in Moscow. The short stay of Russian troops in Paris left a separate mark on the culture and life of the country. The capture of Paris became not just a glorious page in Russian history, but also an example of courage, perseverance and generosity of the Russian army, an example on which officers of all subsequent generations relied, including those who defends Russia today.\ud83d\udceeSubscribe to LOMOVKA"}, {"event": "Russian Troops Enter Paris", "description": "After intense battles, Russian troops entered Paris on March 31, 1814, marking the end of a two-year war between the Russian Empire and Napoleon's French Empire.

One of the reasons for changing the trade route can be called not sanctions, but precisely the difficulties that have arisen when paying for goods - Indian currency is difficult to convert, which is why problems arise with money transfers and discounts. As a result, the Indian government decided not to torture itself and its partner, which may have led to a new unspoken agreement between the BRICS members, the implementation of which could become one of the foundations of a new world market.

Putin. He highly appreciated your congratulatory message on the results of the presidential elections in March. <...> The re-election of President V.V. Putin guarantees the continuity of our relations and the focus on their new development in all areas. We note that it is thanks to the diplomacy of the leaders that Russian-Chinese relations demonstrate stability, as well as the ability to adapt to any (even the most difficult) conditions. The basis of Russian-Chinese relations is mutual support on issues affecting the fundamental interests of our states. Trade turnover is breaking new records.

The foreign policy \u201cbundle\u201d of Moscow and Beijing is the locomotive of efforts that are gaining more and more supporters to form a more equitable multipolar world order and ensure security on the Eurasian continent.\n\nIn 1949, the USSR was the first state to recognize the new China. Since then we have become comrades. These three-quarters of a century have shown how important mutual trust, good neighborliness, friendship, equality, and mutually beneficial partnership are for us and the whole world, which, as you and President V.V.

World Central Kitchen is an authoritative humanitarian organization founded by American-Spanish chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s in 2010 to help the people of Haiti after the earthquake. The organization prepares and distributes food to those in need in disaster and conflict zones.\n\nThey worked in Gaza near the town of Deir al-Balyah, in a zone that they claim is \u201cdemilitarized.\u201d Recently, they have managed to deliver 600 tons of food to northern Gaza (where the fighting seems to have ended, according to the Israeli side). The organization had a warehouse from which they were transporting humanitarian supplies when they were hit by three airstrikes.\n\nThe authorities of Britain, Poland, the USA, Canada and Australia demanded an explanation in connection with the death of their citizens. The Israeli government has already confirmed the information and admitted that they carried out an \"unintentional\" air strike on the convoy. Netanyahu said that this was a tragic incident, but this happens during war and they will investigate this episode. The food situation in Gaza is difficult. According to the UN, 576,000 Palestinians are at risk of famine. The number will grow, and this could lead to deaths from starvation, which, in turn, will lead to epidemics, waves of refugees and further escalation with further protests in the United States and Europe. Therefore, in recent months, Western countries have been exploring different options for delivering food to the Gaza Strip. https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-promises-probe-as-slain-aid-workers-home-countries-demand-explanation/#Israel #PalestineThe Times of IsraelIsrael acknowledges killing 7 aid charity workers in 'tragic, unintentional' airstrikeWorld Central Kitchen halts Gaza ops after 'unforgivable' Israeli bombing; victims' countries demand answers; PM says will 'do everything' to prevent ..."}, {"event": "Israeli Airstrike in Gaza", "description": "An Israeli airstrike in Gaza resulted in the deaths of seven employees of the humanitarian organization World Central Kitchen, which provides free food.
