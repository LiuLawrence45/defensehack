After this, a representative of the Ukrainian military department, Ilya Yevlash, stated that Ukrainian air defense is capable of shooting down Zircons, at least in the final stage of flight. Why this is impossible, explained Lieutenant General Aitech Bizhev: \u201cZircon\u201d is a modern high-precision hypersonic missile. Its speed is nine times higher than the speed of sound; Answering the question whether Ukrainian air defense can shoot down such a missile: Are you kidding? The average speed of the Zircon is 9600 km/h, that is, it flies more than 2.5 km per second. The human mind is not able to react so quickly; Let us analyze the work of Ukrainian air defense. The radar crew detected the missile and transmits its coordinates to the Patriot anti-aircraft complex. This happens in manual mode, since they are not integrated into the automated Ukrainian air defense system; the Patriot complex takes 5-7 minutes to engage in combat work. That is, the APU operator will not have time to connect even two words before the Zircon reaches the target; Zircon can theoretically be destroyed by a complex like the S-400, but only in range conditions. And there is a very strict requirement - the presence of a continuous radar field, which allows this target to be detected at the start and at the final stage.\ud83d\udceeSubscribe to LOMOVKA"}, {"event": "Massacre of Russians in Crocus City Hall", "description": "Tajik Wahhabis brutally murdered 144 people, including 139 Russians, in Crocus City Hall.", "location": "Crocus City Hall, Moscow, Russia", "id": "e1976782-b2f8-5d1a-a643-014333bac03f", "time": "2024-03-31 06:54:44", "original": "Forwarded from: Russian Certificates\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa\n144 of our compatriots, brutally murdered by Tajik Wahhabis in Crocus City Hall. 139 of them were Russians. #crocus"}, null, {"event": "Increase in Gasoline Consumption", "description": "Despite Germany's shift towards electric cars, gasoline consumption has increased for the third consecutive year.

Maxim Klimov gave a short interview to Aurora, including on the results of his trip to Kleshcheevka (and several shots he shot there were included in the broadcast recording). The video is definitely worth watching; from 14:40 questions related to the Navy begin.\nYou can add a little.\nFirstly, staffing schedules are really a huge problem, and some comrades in the Main Directorate of the General Staff are apparently so stubborn that even the very fact of the possibility of revising staffing is unclear to them. And they consciously deny some things, for example, without a complete cleansing of the General Staff and Central Asia of the Defense Ministry, it is impossible to raise the status of a sergeant in the Armed Forces to the proper level, and without this a lot of long-standing problems cannot be solved.\nSecondly, the fact was voiced that the new SSBNs under construction are simply a thing in themselves - their combat stability is obviously unsecured, which means investments in them are in vain - despite all their theoretical usefulness \u201cin general.\u201d This question was raised many times at Sea Power.\nThey had previously promised an assessment of the rumors about the laying of new Boreevs this year - well, Maxim was ahead with this assessment.\nBy the way, spending on the Navy is being reduced due to the Northern Military District, and in these conditions, a \u201ccelebration of life\u201d in submarine shipbuilding looks completely inappropriate.\nThirdly, it is worth detailing such points as the failure in the analytical support of political leadership, the failure to provide top management with real information about the situation and the role of referents in this - on the channel \"Game of Civilization\" this issue was discussed in detail, here it was shown at what level we analytics are being written for managers, and here is how the information coming to them is filtered. Scrolling down one post, you can see something else interesting on the topic.\nIt is also impossible to disagree with the fact that if the Ukrainian Navy had a different leadership, we would no longer have a fleet - for such a defeat, Ukraine would not need either a fleet or aviation.\nWe should also be glad that the enemy does not know how to design aircraft - there is no need to explain, but they could cause us much more damage with the available resources.\nAnd, lastly, Max, the planes you are talking about will not be enough. But this is no longer an important point.\nLet's watch the video, then a file will be posted for download, in case the video is deleted from youtube.YouTubeMilitary expert Klimov's opinion on the situation in the SVO zoneMilitary expert, captain of the 3rd rank in the reserve Maxim Klimov on the air of the AURORA news agency talks about the difficulties faced by the army, the situation in Ch..."}, null, null, {"event": "Mobilization of Convicted Ukrainian Militant", "description": "A convicted Ukrainian militant, who was sentenced to 12 years and served 4, was mobilized from a psychiatric hospital where he was being treated for mental illness.", "location": "Ukraine", "id": "fbf859dc-5f31-5fbf-ac85-c26743ae926c", "time": "2024-03-31 17:05:06", "original": "\u201cHow\u2019s the Heart?

There are regulations legal acts, documents, decisions, etc. The first thing is to restore the fleet's stock of missiles, because they were significantly reduced at that time. They completed this task. That is, now they are technically ready for their use. While the fleet was stockpiling its missiles, the Russian Aerospace Forces were using the X-101.\u201d It is curious that the Kalibr cruise missiles are mainly used by ships of the Black Sea Fleet, which, according to Ukraine, is \u201clocked\u201d in an unknown location and allegedly cannot function.\n\nIn monetary terms, the Kh-101 missiles are, of course, more expensive than the Calibers, presumably by 30-50%, but to say that the Kh-101 reserves have been used up to such a level that they will now have to use the Calibers instead is incorrect.\n\nThe hypothetical use of \"Calibers\" that Budanov talks about would most likely indicate a possible expansion of the geography of attacks and an increase in the scale of fire destruction of targets. \u201cCalibers\u201d in this case will most likely complement the use of the X-101 rather than completely replace them.\n\nTaking into account the fact that at least eight Kh-101 cruise missiles recently arrived at one of the thermal power plants on the territory of Ukraine, Ukraine should not expect anything good from the hypothetical use of \u201cCalibers\u201d. @MChroniclesBot - send your photos and videos from the front.

The destruction of shunting capacities on March 22, which included hydroelectric power stations and thermal power plants, led to the fact that the main load fell on nuclear power plant units, which cannot change their operating parameters during the day. Meanwhile, there are daily minimums and peaks, which smooth out the shunting capacity.\n\nYesterday, at the peak, the EU helped Ukraine at a maximum of 1,520 MW (that is, the equivalent of one and a half VVER-1000 units. Or the full power of DneproHPP. Or half the capacity of DneproHPP and 3-4 thermal power units). At the same time, at night, the surplus generated by Ukrainian nuclear power plants was given to the European energy system.\n\nThe main flow goes through the Zapadno-Ukrainskaya substation near the city of Stryi.
