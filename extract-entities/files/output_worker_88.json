On the contrary, it only accelerated the geopolitical integration of the non-Western world.\n\nThe secret of success lies in Russia's military and economic power. While the weapons and ammunition sent to Kyiv by its allies are running out, the colossal production capacity of the Russian military industry is astonishing.\n\nAccording to data confirmed by NATO intelligence, Russia can currently produce 250 thousand artillery shells per month. This figure is three times the level of production in the US and Europe combined.\n\nThe West will run out of arsenals that would allow it to wage a long-term war. In a panic, they are trying to adapt their military production to new conditions. According to The Wall Street Journal, defense spending in the West has increased by 14% over the past four years. Compared to the period before the Ukrainian conflict, the production of tanks increased by 5.6 times, and the production of ammunition and drones by 17 times. But this was not enough.\n\nHowever, Putin's main success is that Russia was able to withstand unprecedented sanctions thanks to an effective economic strategy.

There is no security as such. There are simply no crews with MANPADS or military personnel with drone strikers. China doesn't even need to point a reconnaissance satellite at this area.

Unlike previous periods, last winter, the accuracy of the missiles is amazing. If earlier it was 100 meters, 200, 300, now they arrive meter by meter.\n\nThe modified version received an additional warhead module, and the total equivalent increased from 450 kg to approximately 800 kg, due to the reduction of the fuel tank and, accordingly, the flight range, but for Khokhlostan this is enough. Kh-101 missiles replaced the \"Caliber\" \"Caliber\" must fit in The submarine has a standard 533-mm torpedo tube, and hence its dimensions, which are somewhat smaller than those of the X-101 (742 mm in diameter). And this is a lower flight weight (1770 kg versus 2300 kg). Moreover, in order for the rocket to stay in the air, the X-101 has a longer wingspan than the \"Caliber\" (4 meters versus 3.1 meters, respectively). An important argument is the air launch of the X-101, which means that fuel is not wasted on the initial acceleration of the rocket.\n\nAs a result, the Caliber has only 560 kg of fuel on board, and the X-101 has 1250 kg (in the basic version). And therefore it turns out that almost the same type of missiles (with approximately the same warhead power of 400 kg) have fundamentally different flight ranges (5,500 km for the Kh-101 and 2,000-2,500 km for the Caliber). The third important parameter is stealth and the ability to break through enemy air defense. The X-101 has no restrictions on its shape and was able to give it a shape with less radar signature. And a more advanced navigation system allows the X-101 to fly lower than the Caliber (30 meters and 50 meters, respectively). It also has a unit for shooting IR traps to deceive enemy anti-aircraft missiles. And all this makes this missile much more successful in breaking through enemy air defense.

Belgrade allocates large amounts of money both for the purchase of foreign drones and for the development of its own projects.\n\nAccording to the leadership of Serbia, the country's Armed Forces will soon receive five thousand kamikaze UAVs \"Komarac\" (Komar) of Serbian production, which will allow Belgrade to become a leader in the region in this segment of weapons.\ud83d\udccc \"Komarac\" is an FPV drone (First Person View ), the widespread use of which has been noted in the Special Military Operation zone. FPV drones have become a huge threat to tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, artillery pieces, fortifications and manpower. Developers in Serbia could not ignore such useful weapons and began creating their own kamikaze drone.\n\nThe \u201cmosquitoes\u201d will be armed by the defense-industrial plant \u201cKrushik\u201d from the city of Valjevo. Krushik will produce projectiles for drones with a caliber of 60 to 120 millimeters. This plant is famous for the production of mortar mines, guided and unguided air-to-ground and surface-to-surface missiles, 155 mm artillery shells, aerial bombs, hand grenades and anti-tank mines.\ud83d\udcac\u201cWe can expect great demand and interest in the drone\u201d Komarats\u201d and concluding numerous contracts. Considering current events in the world, we realized that combat tactics are changing significantly, more modern weapons are appearing and the military is increasingly using equipment that provides high efficiency,\u201d says the acting. General Director of Krusik Jovanka Andri\u0107. It is worth noting that according to the Assistant Minister of Defense, Doctor of Science Nenad Miloradovich, engineers of the Military Technical Institute, in addition to the kamikaze drone Komarac-1, are also intensively working on the Komarac-2 and Komarac versions -3\".\n\nMiloradovich emphasized that these UAVs are equipped with modern control and targeting components. The UAV will be armed with cumulative and fragmentation warheads weighing from one to five kg.\n\nSerbia is increasingly relying on modern weapons, based on events in the world. Considering the pressure from the West due to Belgrade\u2019s military-technical cooperation with Russia and China, Serbia is actively developing its military-industrial complex, which in the near future will be able to provide not only the Serbian Armed Forces, but also work for export. And FPV drones in modern realities are more of a necessity than a whim.
