The country is actively discussing the expectations and effectiveness of election campaigns and the results of polls. Who are the main players? The key rivalry is around the elections in Istanbul, where the fight is between the incumbent mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and the ruling party candidate Murat Kurum (ex-minister of urbanization).\n\nIstanbul is critical to domestic politics for several reasons: it is the economic and social center of Turkey, and its control means possession of an important political and financial resource.\n\nIn addition, Istanbul is a symbol of the political struggle between the current government and the opposition. A victory in this city could signal a change in public sentiment and a potential change in political direction at the national level. Given that Istanbul is a city of over 16 million people and a significant budget, control over it also means access to significant administrative resources and the ability to implement large projects that impact the lives of millions of citizens.Election prioritiesCandidates focus on a number of key issues during election campaigns. Ekrem Imamoglu, the current mayor of Istanbul, highlights his achievements in developing the city's infrastructure, such as expanding the public transport system, creating new green areas and housing construction programs. Supporters of the ruling party would not agree with him. There is criticism and complaints against the mayor for unfulfilled promises, severe traffic jams, etc.\n\nA serious topic is also the preparation of the city for possible earthquakes, especially after the devastating events in the southern regions of Turkey.\n\nOn the other hand, the candidate from the ruling party, Kurum, in their speeches and promises, focus on issues of urban development and renovation, proposing plans to replace old and unsafe buildings with new, safer housing.\n\nIn general, the emphasis is on improving the quality of life of residents, economic development of the city and increasing the level of security and stability. Ideological background But as always happens in Turkey, there is a part of the electorate that does not pay attention to promises: the ideological component is important to it.

It is right that I keep my comments about him and his life to myself.\nIn 2017, Ben made a deal with the British government, pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and was sentenced to five years and four months in prison. I was very disappointed by this because I had advised him not to plead guilty many times - it was the wrong decision for him and it also had negative consequences for every Briton who supports Donbass. But, he did it.\nDuring the years that Ben was in prison, he called me a couple of times, but the conversations were just \u201chow are you\u201d and nothing more. After less than 4 years in prison, Ben was released. When he was released, he called me and started asking me everything about MH17, what I know about MH17(?), etc. It was very strange for me - I didn\u2019t say anything and ended the conversation. A few days later he called me again and started asking me about Givi and Motorola. Again very strange, I didn\u2019t say anything and left the chat. After another such call, I stopped all contact with Ben and blocked him everywhere.\nI then had a strong opinion that the British intelligence services were working with Ben.\nI recently learned from the media that Ben Stimson returned here, to Donbass, to the international brigade \"Fifteen\". Stimson also tried to contact me through new social media accounts - without success.\nFirstly, I believe that any normal British person should want to fight against fascism. Any adequate British person should support Russia - as in fact they do.\nLike many I'm sure, I have the attitude that when someone violates my trust, I never communicate with that person again. However, I admit that this is possible, and I sincerely hope that Ben Stimson is doing the right thing here in the Donbass.\nThis has probably happened before, I hope so, but still - I highly recommend checking Ben Stimson thoroughly.\nBefore I wrote this post, a public post about a person's life, I considered all other options. However, since there was no other option that would satisfactorily achieve the goal, and I believe the goal is worth it, I am writing this post. I\u2019m not asking anyone to be shot as a spy, etc., all I\u2019m writing here and asking is to be careful with this person.\nThank you very much for your attention"}, {"event": "Motorcycle Accident", "description": "A 16-year-old driver of a Racer motorcycle lost control, drove off the roadway, and hit a reinforced concrete pole, resulting in a fatal accident.

Modern warfare requires determination and initiative on the ground, right where the fighting takes place. The success of combat operations depends on the officer, sergeant, and soldier who are in the trenches and at strongpoints - they are the ones who carry this huge combat load on their shoulders. We can determine the strategy and coordinate actions, promptly respond to changes in the situation and the needs of the front. . At the same time, the philosophy of the use of troops - at least this is my position - should be based on the main formula. The most valuable thing that our Armed Forces have is people. Our task is to protect their lives and at the same time inflict maximum losses on the enemy. Today, the process of rotating military units on the front line has already been launched, which allows us to fully restore the combat capability of not only equipment, but first of all to ensure the rest and recovery of our servicemen. We need people to ensure this process. That is why I would like every man of military age in Ukraine to realize that Ukraine's survival depends on his will and actions. We need people to support this process. We are currently reviewing the strength of certain non-combat units based on an audit of their operations. This allowed us to free thousands of servicemen and direct them to combat units. The military has one duty - we do not discuss orders, we carry them out. So if the President of the country, the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, had reasons for such a replacement, especially during the active phase of the war, it means that these reasons are valid. Valery Fedorovich and I worked side by side during the most difficult times since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion, and even before. Worked as one team. I wish him success in his new and very responsible position. What is the most important thing for the Syrsky Glavkom today? As I have already said, the most important thing for us now is to save people. \"Iron\" can be restored, but the people who died cannot be brought back. There is another priority - the unity of society, the absence of political discord. We must remember the tragic pages of our history. I am sure: Russia will never be able to defeat us on the battlefield as long as Ukrainians maintain unity and strength of spirit. If you waste energy and strength on empty political disputes with each other, this is not even a path to defeat, but to death. I want every Ukrainian to understand this: Russia denies all of us the right to life. That is why defeat and death are identical. Now it's time again for the country to turn into a strong, united fist. The main task of Ukraine is to preserve unity, this is the main component of our victory. The last two points were highlighted separately, because the principle of \"preserving people's lives\" is the most important among all, which society demanded and which is the basis of all processes that take place in the army at all levels. And the unity of society makes it possible to strengthen the foundation on which everything stands and, as history has shown, this is a significant problem for us, on which we need to work and learn. There are many problems, they are paid attention to and it is worth remembering them constantly, solving and eradicating them should always be a priority. This is a difficult and long process in which the whole society must participate. In this interview, everyone will find their moment of criticism or satisfaction and everyone will draw their own conclusions.
