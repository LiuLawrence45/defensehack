He visited the workshops where various types of aircraft engines are assembled, including the new models PD-14, PD-8 and PD-35. In fact, these engines are not assembled at Salyut; they make separate units and components for them. We just felt bad for Perm and Rybinsk, which are the ones who collect them. \u201cIt is necessary to increase production and testing capacities, and additionally attract employees of various specialties. At the moment, this process has been launched, hard work is underway, which is already beginning to bear fruit,\u201d emphasized Denis Manturov. Personnel decide everything if they are found, trained and retained. Especially in Moscow for blue-collar jobs. Salyut is introducing advanced technologies, including the creation of a digital twin of an aircraft engine, which improves engine performance and reduces the cost of its production and maintenance. Standard intrusive advertising of digital technologies. But at UEC, the most advanced engine in this regard (of the open ones) is the import-substituted engine for the Yak-130 assembled at Salyut. Digitalization and design of deep modernization - from AI-222-25 to SM-100 - is truly the result of the introduction of new technologies for creating aircraft engines. This year, on the territory of the Salyut production complex in Moscow, they began to build a production complex that will become one of the largest engine building centers countries. It will unite MMP named after V.V. under one roof. Chernyshev, the Salyut production complex and the Center for Additive Technologies of the Rostec state corporation. Just the territory of the MMP named after. Chernyshev was sold out for this idea of unification long ago (with a delay in release), so now they hope that workers from Tushino will move together to Budyonny Avenue. As part of the Comprehensive Program for the Development of the Air Transport Industry until 2030, the enterprise is digitalizing its production facilities - towards an industrial Internet system of Things (IIoT) has already connected more than 1,000 pieces of key production equipment. The operation of machine tools is monitored and analyzed in real time, and the efficiency of using existing reserves increases. Is this why not a single machine appears in the frame? We understand that this is because of sanctions, so that spiteful critics do not later post photos of foreign machines that professionals can easily recognize even with blurred inscriptions. Or did they add IIoT to a vice with a non-electronic caliper?

Let's start with the background. During combat missions in Afghanistan, separate detachments of the 15th and 22nd GRU special forces brigades had at their disposal attached artillery and army aviation units. This made it possible to shorten the chain of approvals and quickly provide support to reconnaissance groups and reconnaissance detachments that were leaving for work.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Union, and with the outbreak of hostilities in Chechnya, the question of \u201cheavy\u201d support for special forces units, which would work exclusively in the interests of these units, again arose. Starting from May-June 1995, only two detachments from the 67th and 22nd OBRSpN operated in Chechnya, which were there until the withdrawal of the OGV in the fall of 1996. For that year and a half, both detachments had their own BTR-80 and BMP-2, which worked only in the interests of these detachments.\n\nWith the end of the first campaign, many experienced officers understood that they would have to return to the North Caucasus in the foreseeable future, so they began to prepare. This happened in the 22nd OBRSpN, which among the brigades was always ahead of the rest in terms of experiments and testing of new ways of performing combat missions. In 1998, at the instigation of some officers, including Hero of Russia Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Nedobezhkin, Oleg Martyanov and Rudtsky, the formation of the PLO, a fire support detachment, began. We have already written about this in detail several times.\n\nAnd now, February 2022. At the forefront of the attacking forces are eight OBRSpN and one regiment of army special forces. Only armored vehicles of the Tiger-M SpN, Lynx and KAMAZ Typhoons types are in service. Of the heavy weapons, only AGS-17 and 12.7-mm Kord machine guns. A plus is ATGMs, including the scarce \u201cCornets\u201d, the installations from which are passed on like a banner from company to company. Groups and detachments of brigades most often have to operate in the formation of advancing forces, including during assaults on villages and cities. Heavy equipment to support scouts has to be begged from the infantry, the same goes for artillery. All this complicates life somewhat, due to the already weak organization between the units, as well as the behavior of some commanders who can easily exchange the assigned special forces. Simply because he is a dowry. At the same time, there are many examples when the establishment of connections directly on the spot between the commanders of special forces units and motorized rifle units led to a qualitative breakthrough in the accomplishment of combat missions. But today they are together, and tomorrow they are already in different areas, and interaction must be established in a new way. It was the same with mortars, which had to be delivered in a roundabout way, and they had to learn to work independently with 82-mm and 120-mm mortars in an accelerated mode.\n\nAnd then a veteran of the GRU special forces, a legendary personality for those who served with him, appears on the stage of the North Military District - Lieutenant Colonel Andrei Borisovich Panferov, a participant in battles in Afghanistan and Chechnya, a man with enormous experience. At his suggestion, as part of the 24th Guards. The OBRSpN is forming the \u201cVega\u201d detachment, the first \u201cheavy\u201d detachment within the brigades. They are also armed with the BMP-3, which can support the actions of groups on the front line with their fire. Of course, when you have your own equipment \u201cunder the ass\u201d, it makes life much easier.

This is due to the ongoing process of formation of a multipolar world order. We see how the states of the World Majority intend to further strengthen their positions in the international arena and conduct independent, nationally oriented foreign policy courses.\n\n\u2022 We consistently advocate the implementation of a unifying international agenda aimed at creating favorable conditions for the development of all states and peoples without exception, and not just a narrow group of \u201cselected ones.\u201d\u261d\ufe0fUnfortunately, the \u201ccollective West\u201d led by the United States does not abandon attempts, if not reverse this objective historical process, then at least delay the onset of inevitable changes.\n\n\u2022 Against this background, we consider the growing interest of an increasing number of countries in the Global South in the activities of BRICS to be logical and natural. The point is that our association is not trying to \u201creverse\u201d the objective historical processes of the formation of polycentricity. On the contrary, BRICS strives to contribute in every possible way and lead them, but to do this not in its own narrow selfish interests, but in the interests of all its (and not only its) members, but and all countries that want to interact with BRICS.\n\n\u2022 Our cooperation is based on an equal dialogue, respect for each country\u2019s choice of its own path of development, consideration of each other\u2019s interests and a focus on a collective search for solutions to all problems of our time. I will say without exaggeration that today BRICS acts as a \u201cspokesman\u201d for the interests of the entire non-Western world.\u2022 We have no doubt that attracting a wide range of developing countries to interact with the association will contribute to the further consolidation of the efforts of the World Majority to solve common problems in common interests.
