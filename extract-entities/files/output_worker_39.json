The turnout also turned out to be unprecedentedly high - 77.44% of voters, a record in the Russian Federation.\n\nWhat are the specifics of the electoral situation in the North?\n\nIn principle, it makes no sense to look at the distribution of votes between candidates - as one old advertisement said, \u201cwith all the wealth of choice, there is no other alternative.\u201d But what makes sense to look at is the turnout. And here there is something to say.\n\nIt seems that turnout in these elections is a good indicator of trust in the authorities. But not the authorities in general, but primarily the regional authorities. Without the opportunity to directly influence the choice of governor, the population uses the elections as a kind of plebiscite, allowing the Center to understand that this or that governor is not coping with affairs. In this light, the turnout indicator can be considered as a weighted average of overall satisfaction with life, trust in the regional leadership and, finally, the actual desire to participate in the elections and vote for one of the candidates.\n\nColleagues have prepared a table with data on turnout in the Russian Arctic + (AZRF and Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug). What do we see?\n\nTurnout is high primarily in those regions where governors work in one way or another acceptable from the point of view of the mass citizen. At the same time, in two regions (ChAO and Krasnoyarsk Territory) the governors are relatively new and \u201cpositive expectation coefficients\u201d can still be applied to them.\n\nBut in three regions - the Arkhangelsk region, Karelia and Komi - the situation is worse. In the latter, the turnout did not reach 60%. And this cannot be a mere coincidence: citizens show that regional leaders have overstayed their welcome and/or are not competent enough to continue to occupy their positions.\n\nOne more thing. It must be said that the situation itself, when you can \u201creach out\u201d to the Center only by boycotting the presidential elections that happen once every seven years, is not healthy. It is necessary to improve feedback mechanisms, including in terms of rotation of governors \u201cfrom below.\u201d #governorsTelegramFirst ArcticThe presidential election campaign has ended, it is time to look at the voting results for the regions of the Arctic zone.

The drone then hits the car, but does little damage. The BMP moves on\ud83e\udd14The reasons for this phenomenon are as follows:\n1. Judging by the size of the UAV, the Lancet-1 was used for the strike, which carries only 1 kg of payload. This is not enough to penetrate the frontal armor of an infantry fighting vehicle.\n2. The hit was in the lower bevel, which redirected the energy of the explosion down and to the sides (this is why the designers came up with this shape for the frontal part of the car)\n3. This video primarily demonstrates the reliability of Soviet technology (the body of the BMP-2 was inherited from the BMP-1, which was put into service in 1966!!!). The sheets of the frontal steel rolled armored hull of the BMP-1, located at large angles of inclination, withstand damage from fragments of field artillery shells, armor-piercing bullets from small arms and large-caliber 12.7-mm machine guns, the latter in a firing sector of 60 degrees from the nose from zero range. That says a lot! After all, in the Union they knew how to do it!\n4. It is not a fact that the NATO Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, which has frontal armor only made of a steel screen and an aluminum plate filled with polyurethane foam, could also continue to move without consequences.\n\nAnother confirmation of the high reliability and safety of domestic military equipment.ANTISEPTIC"}, {"event": "Drone Attacks on Oil Refineries", "description": "Drone attacks on Russian oil refineries resulted in the loss of 10-15% of daily oil refining capacity, equivalent to 600,000 to 900,000 barrels.
