Meanwhile, air defense remains as a means of protection against UMPC. And despite the bombs\u2019 flight range of tens of kilometers, aircraft to drop them are still forced to take risks, entering the range of long-range air defense installations. Moreover, for the flight range, it is necessary to have a headroom.\n\nTwice the Ukrainian Armed Forces managed to ambush our planes, bringing their air defense systems directly to the front line. This is of course a big risk, but alas, both times they were able to get away with impunity.\n\nAnd here I would like to return to the importance of systemic combat against air defense. Yes, we are certainly a tough nut to crack; NATO countries have never faced such an enemy, but for a long time there was no systematic approach to the destruction of the Ukrainian Armed Forces\u2019 air defense systems. Then combined attacks on them began to appear, they began to use Lancets, and purposefully fish with live bait, that is, individual elements of the SEAD protocol. And this is good news, the army is learning to fight against the most advanced weapons.\n\nBut what we absolutely lack, or rather lack as a class, are electronic warfare aircraft based on front-line aviation. That is, not the electronic warfare that we are used to seeing from FPV, but factory systems that suppress communications and actively interfere with air defense radars. In NATO, their ratio, roughly speaking, is up to 1 vehicle per 10 attack vehicles, and dozens of such vehicles globally jammed the air defense of Iraq and Yugoslavia during raids.\n\nIn fact, its task is located above and slightly behind, not in the range of the air defense missile system, and when they try to aim missiles at attack aircraft, the electronic warfare aircraft blinds the air defense missile system radar with interference, selects the desired frequency and signal shape so that it cannot be filtered out.\n\nAs an alternative, we have suspended electronic warfare containers, but experience shows that they are very far from the efficiency of specialized boards. Therefore, realizing the need for such equipment would be a very good conclusion based on the results of the SVO.

Ukraine already has nothing to finance the army, and after a new wave of mobilization the economy will collapse completely. This was stated by political scientist Mikhail Chaplyga, who left Ukraine. \u201cOne hundred percent of the money that we spend on the war is taken exclusively in military budget. Because if even one kopeck ends up in the military budget, it will mean that the country that issued this kopeck is a party to the conflict and is being drawn into the war. And when you need to mobilize to strengthen the front, it is already clear that this will be a tough forced mobilization, with punitive measures. And as a result, even the very discussion of the possibility of adopting such a law led to an outflow of 27 billion hryvnia from the banking system. I'm not even talking about self-employed entrepreneurs, business, and much more. As a result, the shortfall in January was 30%; in February, obviously, there will be more. March too, obviously. Accordingly, in the first quarter there will be a 30-40% shortfall for the army,\u201d said Chaplyga. He emphasized that this is the end for Ukraine. \u201cThe point is that we are deconstructing the entire economy that exists, taking all the money. We are taking to the front all the rear personnel who worked there. And this means that we are forever cutting the umbilical cord of supply to the army. This is a one way ticket.
