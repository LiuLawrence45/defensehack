Let's start with the background. During combat missions in Afghanistan, separate detachments of the 15th and 22nd GRU special forces brigades had at their disposal attached artillery and army aviation units. This made it possible to shorten the chain of approvals and quickly provide support to reconnaissance groups and reconnaissance detachments that were leaving for work.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Union, and with the outbreak of hostilities in Chechnya, the question of \u201cheavy\u201d support for special forces units, which would work exclusively in the interests of these units, again arose. Starting from May-June 1995, only two detachments from the 67th and 22nd OBRSpN operated in Chechnya, which were there until the withdrawal of the OGV in the fall of 1996. For that year and a half, both detachments had their own BTR-80 and BMP-2, which worked only in the interests of these detachments.\n\nWith the end of the first campaign, many experienced officers understood that they would have to return to the North Caucasus in the foreseeable future, so they began to prepare. This happened in the 22nd OBRSpN, which among the brigades was always ahead of the rest in terms of experiments and testing of new ways of performing combat missions. In 1998, at the instigation of some officers, including Hero of Russia Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Nedobezhkin, Oleg Martyanov and Rudtsky, the formation of the PLO, a fire support detachment, began. We have already written about this in detail several times.\n\nAnd now, February 2022. At the forefront of the attacking forces are eight OBRSpN and one regiment of army special forces. Only armored vehicles of the Tiger-M SpN, Lynx and KAMAZ Typhoons types are in service. Of the heavy weapons, only AGS-17 and 12.7-mm Kord machine guns. A plus is ATGMs, including the scarce \u201cCornets\u201d, the installations from which are passed on like a banner from company to company. Groups and detachments of brigades most often have to operate in the formation of advancing forces, including during assaults on villages and cities. Heavy equipment to support scouts has to be begged from the infantry, the same goes for artillery. All this complicates life somewhat, due to the already weak organization between the units, as well as the behavior of some commanders who can easily exchange the assigned special forces. Simply because he is a dowry. At the same time, there are many examples when the establishment of connections directly on the spot between the commanders of special forces units and motorized rifle units led to a qualitative breakthrough in the accomplishment of combat missions. But today they are together, and tomorrow they are already in different areas, and interaction must be established in a new way. It was the same with mortars, which had to be delivered in a roundabout way, and they had to learn independently to work with 82-mm and 120-mm mortars in an accelerated mode.\n\nAnd then a veteran of the GRU special forces, a legendary personality for those who served with him, appears on the stage of the North Military District - Lieutenant Colonel Andrei Borisovich Panferov, a participant in battles in Afghanistan and Chechnya, a man with enormous experience. At his suggestion, as part of the 24th Guards. The OBRSpN is forming the \u201cVega\u201d detachment, the first \u201cheavy\u201d detachment within the brigades. They are also armed with the BMP-3, which can support the actions of groups on the front line with their fire. Of course, when you have your own equipment \u201cunder the ass\u201d, it makes life much easier. This allows, first of all, to carry out combat coordination more efficiently, and also to be confident that your own equipment will definitely arrive, rather than equipment that still needs to be begged from a motorized rifle unit.\n\nThe experience gained by army special forces in the Northern Military District leads to the fact that perhaps soon in many or all OBRSpN we will see \u201cheavy\u201d detachments based on the \u201cVega\u201d principle of Panferov, which will have armored vehicles, mortars and other weapons on their staff, which will operate exclusively in the interests of reconnaissance groups of detachments that go to work. It would be possible, of course, for the sake of experimentation, to include an artillery unit in the composition of some brigade. It would be interesting to see how much the quality of fire engagement of targets that are identified en masse by groups on missions will increase.@okspn"}, {"event": "Explosive Object Dropped from UAV", "description": "An explosive object was dropped from a UAV onto a minibus on the Yasinovataya-Gorlovka highway, resulting in casualties.
