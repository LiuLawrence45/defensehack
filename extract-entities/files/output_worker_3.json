According to him, the provision of equipment to Kyiv is also influenced by the economic situation in the West.\n\nPresident of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky has nothing to do with what weapons will be sent to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, so it doesn\u2019t matter what the leader of the Square will beg for. Military expert, chairman of the Veche MOO Vladimir Orlov told Readovka.News who is behind this conflict, and whether Kyiv will be able to protect its airspace due to the presence of problems with air defense systems.\n\nRecently, former US intelligence officer Scott Ritter acknowledged the advantage of the Russian army in the air and noted that Ukraine is experiencing an acute shortage of air defense systems.\n\nOrlov emphasized that the problem with air defense is quite serious. Moreover, it cannot be solved by sending two or three additional systems, since these defensive systems are built on the configuration of the front line, depending on what the enemy has.\n\n\u201cYou need to understand that Patriot is not the cheapest pleasure; the ammunition is very expensive. In order to use them, they need to be produced or removed from other threatened areas and transferred to Kyiv,\u201d Orlov said.\nDue to the fact that Patriot has recently become an easy target for Russian troops thanks to the reconnaissance of the Russian Armed Forces, the West will supply less expensive air defense systems that will protect Kiev from drones or be able to intercept aircraft in their small range, the military expert noted. According to him, at the moment Western countries are experiencing some problems in the economy, so we should not expect new supplies of weapons. After all, just one salvo costs about a million dollars, Orlov said.\n\nAs for sending ammunition to the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the United States, in this case everything is decided by the Pentagon, the expert recalled.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what he [Zelensky \u2013 Ed.] will beg, it is not he who decides what weapons will be given to the zone of military conflict, but those who control this conflict.
