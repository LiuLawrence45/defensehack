While all the leading countries of the world are accumulating debts, Russia manages to pay them off without a significant impact on financial stability. At the beginning of 2022, the external debt amounted to 488 billion with the maximum volume for all time being 733 billion (2Q14 before the introduction of Crimean sanctions), and two years later - 317 billion. However, debt in foreign currency is important, because\n\n\u2022 Firstly, due to restrictions on foreign exchange funding, the shortage of foreign currency in the domestic market has a negative impact on the ruble exchange rate.\n\nThe accumulation of foreign exchange positions to repay external debt was one of the reasons for the collapse of the ruble in mid-2023 against the background of the depletion of the current account surplus.\n\n\u2022 Secondly, ruble-denominated external debt is more than successfully balanced by internal cash flows or, if necessary, regulatory easing.\n\nThe one who directly issues debt always has operational freedom in managing the debt position, which cannot be said about debt in foreign currency, placed, as a rule, in a foreign jurisdiction. There has been significant progress with foreign currency debt: at the beginning of 2022 it was 353 billion, but became 208 billion, and the all-time maximum was in 1Q14 at the level of 549 billion, i.e. reduction by 1.7 times in two years and 2.5 times in 10 years.

Ukraine completely denies accusations of involvement in the terrorist attack.\n\nWhat will Russia do in response?\n\nIn fact, the Russian Federation is already waging a full-scale war against Ukraine, using all possible types of weapons except nuclear ones.\n\nWill Russia use nuclear weapons? There could be an extremely negative international reaction. Including from countries friendly to the Russian Federation. Like, for example, China, which has repeatedly stated that it is against the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nWill the Russian Federation try to kill Zelensky, Malyuk, Budanov? As for the last two, they were already a possible target for Russian strikes. At least last year, Russian media actively wrote that Budanov was allegedly killed or wounded during attacks on Kyiv.

However, after the Russian security forces themselves documented and distributed through telegram channels photos and videos of beatings, cutting off ears and electrocuting suspects, the credibility of their testimony is zero even in the eyes of countries loyal to the Russian Federation and foreign politicians.\n\nThen what is the purpose of the statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry?\n\nIt can be assumed that its main addressee is not Kyiv, but the West.\n\nRussia has long been sending hints to the West that expanding support for Ukraine, including the supply of a number of types of weapons, could lead to a direct military clash between the Russian Federation and NATO with the prospect of a transition to nuclear war. This is something that the West does not want to allow (at least the leaders of the largest countries).\n\nAnd the statement accusing Ukraine of a terrorist attack once again demonstrates Russia\u2019s readiness to take the war to a different level in order to block the expansion of Western assistance. At least from wavering countries like Germany.\n\nAlthough whether this will work is an open question.\n\nAlso, naturally, promoting the version of Ukraine\u2019s involvement also has internal Russian goals - strengthening the public\u2019s readiness to continue the war and increasing the level of its support.
