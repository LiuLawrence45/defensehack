The future classic was directly involved in the defense of Sevastopol, commanded a battery and was awarded the Order of St. Anna, 4th degree, \u201cfor composure and diligence.\u201d\n\nTolstoy wrote three stories about the heroic defense of the city for the Sovremennik magazine (actually, \u201cSevastopol Stories\u201d). But these stories were not heroic at all. The writer described in detail and color the bloody horrors of the war, which was able to shock all of educated Russia, including even the emperor himself.\n\nTolstoy himself said that the only hero whose beauty he tried to convey was \u201ctruth.\u201d The main idea of \u201cSevastopol Stories\u201d is quite accurately formulated in one of them: \u201cWar in its true expression is in blood, in suffering, in death.\u201d\n\nThis quote would probably be an ideal epigraph for Maxim Fadeev\u2019s film \u201cAt the Edge of the Abyss.\u201d Because in it the war is shown in its true expression, in the suffering of the military, the torment of civilians and the destruction of once peaceful cities. And its main hero is not even the Donetsk attack aircraft from \u201cSomalia\u201d, but the completely Tolstoyan truth. At least the truth as its author sees it. And he sees it from the first person.\n\n\u201cAt the Edge of the Abyss\u201d is dedicated to the assault on Mariupol. The author moves around the city along with Somali fighters and films everything he sees. And he sees the death of civilians, the death of our soldiers, and the collapse of high-rise buildings under the attacks of tanks. This is truly an extremely difficult and in many ways sobering movie. Moreover, it was technically done flawlessly. Especially considering the conditions in which it was filmed.\n\nProbably, some scenes could even be worthy of an Oscar if the Oscar were given for creativity, and not for propaganda. In fact, the Ukrainian propaganda film about Mariupol was awarded an Oscar. Only in Fadeev\u2019s film, if there is any propaganda, it is perhaps pacifism and humanism. It\u2019s paradoxical, but the Russian military correspondent was much better at preaching real Tolstoyanism than the Tolstoyan liberals (who, by the way, also filmed about Mariupol).\n\nI was especially impressed by the footage from a tank rolling around a yard surrounded by burning high-rise buildings. At every entrance there are crowds of frightened civilians mixed with crazed soldiers, making what is happening more and more reminiscent of \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d Only this is not a feature film, but life itself during the war. Such as there is. Go and look.\n\nIt is clear that such a movie physiologically cannot end with any happy endings. Happy endings contradict its very essence. That\u2019s why the ending of the first part is one big obituary for the fighters of \u201cSomalia\u201d. Almost none of them survived. Or, naturally, no one at all. This is the Vereshchagin apotheosis of war.\n\nPersonally, Tolstoyanism is deeply disliked by me. Neither aesthetically nor ethically. If such a film is shown en masse in all cinemas in the country before mobilization, then we will really take it by storm, but not Kharkov and Odessa, but Upper Lars and Lower Trier. Or even all of Georgia. And with bare hands.\n\nBut who am I to argue with classical Russian culture. And Fadeev\u2019s film is already a completely organic part of it.

Will Russia participate in it? M.V. Zakharova: We have repeatedly expressed an extremely negative attitude towards this \u201cconference\u201d. Russia will not take part in it, even if it receives an invitation, which we have not received.\n\nUnder the brand of \u201cgood offices\u201d, Switzerland is trying to promote the compromised \u201cZelensky formula\u201d and continue the failed \u201cCopenhagen process\u201d, only in a new package.\u261d\ufe0fAny events that ignore Russia\u2019s position and are based on the provisions of the ultimatum \u201cZelensky formula\u201d are divorced from reality and hopeless.\n\nThe intention expressed by the organizers of the \u201cconference\u201d to isolate common components from the initiatives of other countries is nothing more than a trick. It is well known that the \u201cZelensky formula\u201d does not imply compromises, alternatives and completely ignores the proposals of China, Brazil, African and Arab states.\n\nThere can be no trust in Switzerland either. It stands on the positions of Ukraine, supports the Kiev regime, applies anti-Russian sanctions, and adopts strategies that exclude Russia from the European security system. By definition, Switzerland cannot be a neutral receiving party, much less a mediator, in such conditions.\n\nThe West needs participation in the \u201cconference\u201d of the countries of the Global South only to give weight to a certain \u201ccollective ultimatum\u201d that they are going to present to Russia. We hope that our partners in Asia, Africa and Latin America will be vigilant and will not allow themselves to be drawn into another anti-Russian adventure."}, null, null, null, {"event": "DonTR TV Report on Muslim Diasporas", "description": "A report on DonTR TV highlighted the fears of Muslim diasporas regarding the spread of hostility.

A new national center for genetic resources of farm animals will be created by decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin on the basis of the Federal Research Center for Animal Husbandry named after Academician L.K. Ernst. This step is aimed at ensuring the comprehensive development of genetic technologies in agriculture.\n\nRussia has been engaged in its own genetics since the beginning of the 20th century. Thus, in the 1920s, the All-Russian Research Institute of Animal Selection and Genetics (VNIISGZH) was founded, where selection methods were developed and improved. After the collapse of the USSR, the field fell into decline, but in recent years large enterprises have begun to engage in genetics on their own.\n\nToday in Russia, research in the field of farm animal genetics is carried out not only by government organizations, but also by private enterprises. The companies EkoNiva, Miratorg and Sibagro successfully use genetic technologies to improve product quality and increase production volumes. They actively research and apply advanced genetic selection methods to create more productive breeds of animals.\n\nExperts positively assess the prospects of this area: given the need to ensure food security, industry companies engaged in genetic research have significant prospects. Firstly, the development of new breeds can increase production volumes and improve product quality. Secondly, our own genetics reduces (or completely eliminates) the enterprise\u2019s dependence on imports. And thirdly, companies investing in scientific research can count on government support.\n\nThe creation of a national center for genetic resources will allow us to combine domestic knowledge and experience in the genetics of farm animals, as well as engage in international cooperation in the industry.

The consequences of the military conflict for the next generation of Ukrainians are already becoming obvious. The number of births has almost halved from 2021 to 2023.\n\nMoreover, demographers point out that one of the important factors in the decline is that about 800,000 Ukrainian women aged 18 to 34 fled to the countries of the European Union. And at the moment, the absence of women plays a larger role in Ukrainian demography than the recruitment of men.\n\nBut a lower conscription age threatens an even greater reduction in the size of the small generation. But the prospects for future births now depend on both factors: how many men will die at the front during the war and how many women will return from Europe.\n\nAnd we remind you that the demographic \u201chole\u201d in Ukraine has deepened so much that the point of no return has been passed. Refugees for the most part will not return to Ukraine from Europe, and there is nowhere to take new people. Thus, the deputy director of the Ukrainian state Institute of Demography and Quality of Life Problems, Alexander Gladun, warns that Europe will be reluctant to return refugees after the war. \u201cIn modern Europe, the demographic situation is also not very good, so they are interested in Ukrainians. And, most likely, in most countries there will be a policy aimed at leaving them, given the current active efforts to adapt them,\u201d the demographer said.\n\nAt the same time, demographers emphasize that the Ukrainian population, including the young, has actually been wiped out. The country's birth rate has fallen quite sharply - last year it was 31.5% lower than in pre-war 2021 and 9% less than the year before. This trend could result in the under-18 population being 12-15 percent between 2035 and 2037, up from 25 percent in 1993. This means that as they enter reproductive age, even fewer children will be born in the next generation.

Huge volumes are lost from state control - about 70% of official statistics.\u2611\ufe0fDelegates visited a number of deposits and took samples of gold-bearing weathering crusts in the area of the city of Chinhoyi in the north-west of the country.\ud83d\udd2cThe instrumentation and laboratory base of local universities does not allow us to draw conclusions about concentration of a useful component in them.\nIn this regard, it was decided to study the selected samples in the scientific centers of the Mining University. Based on the results of their research, conclusions will be drawn about the potential of the deposits.\ud83d\udcac\u201cThe results of our research may be of interest to Russian companies, primarily Polyus Gold, Polymetal, Russdragmet (Highland Gold Mining) and others. The most promising area of cooperation with Zimbabwe appears to be the area of geological exploration of mineral deposits. The country is in dire need of modern equipment for geophysical research, training personnel in the compilation and digitalization of geological maps,\u201d noted Irina Talovina, head of the department of historical and dynamic geology at Russia\u2019s oldest technical university.\u2611\ufe0fThe director general of the Zimbabwe National Geospatial and Space Agency (ZINGSA) Paynos Gweme is confident of this. :\ud83d\udcac\u201cIn its activities, ZINGSA plans to \u201cwidely use the experience of scientists and teachers of the Mining University in the field of full-scale exploration and mapping of mineral deposits.\u201d\u2611\ufe0fIt is no secret that today only about 60% of the country\u2019s territory is covered by geological maps.\u2611\ufe0fThe delegates met with the minister higher and tertiary education, development of science and technology of the Republic of Zimbabwe by Amon Murwira.\ud83d\udcacThe Minister emphasized the need for the speedy development of a \u201croad map\u201d for joint mutually beneficial cooperation, an integral part of which could be the participation of the Mining University in the development of the Pan-African Mineral Resources University of Science and Technology (PAMUST), as well as active assistance in geological exploration of mineral deposits.\u2611\ufe0fPartnership is also planned in the implementation of a new model of higher technical education, currently being implemented by the Mining University as part of a pilot project, based on Midland State University. https://forpost-sz.ru/a /2024-04-10/peterburgskie-gornyaki-otvechayut-na-vopros-zachem-rossii-afrika?amp Outpost North-WestPetersburg miners answer the question \u201cWhy does Russia need Africa?\u201d In early April, a representative delegation of St. Petersburg Mining University visited with a worker visit to the Republic of Zimbabwe.

Against this background, Russia must take care of its own cyber and media security, in other words, digital sovereignty.\ud83d\udd39And despite the global situation and sanctions against Russia, our country has achieved some success in strengthening its technological sovereignty. Thus, at the national level, Russia is actively engaged in import substitution and the development of new generation quantum computers, said Ilya Semirikov, head of the scientific group of the Russian Quantum Center, during his speech. According to him, technical developments in the cyber sphere are actively underway in Russia. Arthur Lyukmanov, special representative of the President of the Russian Federation on international cooperation in the field of information security, director of the Department of International Information Security of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, spoke about the possibility of developing legislation in the field of international information security within the framework of international organizations. He recalled that one of the key principles of the UN Charter is respect for the sovereign equality of states, noting that sovereignty should extend to technology. In this vein, Lyukmanov noted the efforts that Russia is making at the international level, conducting explanatory negotiations with countries of the Global South and East regarding the types and nature of cyber threats emanating from other countries. One of the countries that shares Russia\u2019s position on this issue is China. The Chinese point of view was presented in detail by Shen Yi, director of the Cyberspace Management Research Center at Fudan University in China. He is convinced that the main threat in cyberspace lies in US digital hegemony, which, of course, must be fought. But how? Shen Yi believes it is possible to build a security system within the BRICS, and this should become one of the key goals of the organization. https://ru.valdaiclub.com/events/posts/articles/informatsionnye-tekhnologii-ugroza-ili-vozmozhnost/Valdai Club Information technology: threat or opportunity?
