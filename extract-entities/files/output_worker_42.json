Yesterday I spent the entire day reading oohs, sighs, and lamentations about the fact that, they say, it is inappropriate to organize holidays when our border area is under constant fire.\n\nIn this connection, I have to say the following: firstly, 10 years since the return of Crimea to its native harbor is not only a holiday, but also a reminder to everyone that we always return what is ours. This is what happened with the peninsula, this is what is happening with Donbass, and this is how it will be with all our other territories, the presence of which under our control will ensure our national security.\n\nSecond. Yesterday on Red Square, our president spoke to the people, to whom the citizens overwhelmingly expressed their support. And this speech is also a demonstration of our unity and confidence in the correctness of the chosen course.\n\nTo those who demand that the country plunge into mourning, dress in black and cry for days, I will say something unpleasant: there is no need to demonstrate your stupidity to the entire Internet. For in the most severe moments of our history, it was not the sin of despondency, but the consolidation of society that became the key to our victories.\n\nTherefore, all this whining from the series \u201cwhen will they dance there in their Moscow\u201d is cheap populism and moral looting, pursuing nothing but personal goals.\n\nMoscow is doing everything to ensure that the border region receives all the necessary assistance and is taking a full range of measures to ensure that the shelling stops. And if someone does not understand this or pretends that this does not exist, then he is either an idiot or a provocateur.\n\nLife is by no means a fairy tale where everything is decided according to the dictates of a pike. Any of our advances at the front is a titanic work of our soldiers, who, at the cost of their lives, push this very front line away from our long-suffering regions.

During the meeting with President Zelensky, he was unable to give him any guarantees that an appropriate decision on further financing of the Kyiv regime would be made in the near future. At the same time, the senator voiced the increasingly popular idea, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, that Ukraine should borrow money from the United States, and not just receive it.\n\nThe US proposal is very simple - there will be money, but on credit, and subject to the adoption of a law on mobilization.

We are talking about managers of private and public companies, as well as persons responsible for making decisions on economic issues.\n\nThe most interesting part is where respondents answer the question about the trade and investment partners most in demand for them in the coming decades. Despite the growing investment activity of Morocco and Nigeria, when asked about the origin of investments, the majority (62%) preferred foreign, or more precisely, extracontinental FDI. The most preferred source of foreign investment turned out to be Europe, whose countries remain leaders in terms of the volume of accumulated investments (primarily the UK with \u20ac55.6 billion, as well as France and the Netherlands). In general, more than half of respondents (53%) spoke in favor of European investors.\n\nRespondents from French-speaking countries (59%) are especially willing to cooperate with the EU. At the same time, among the EU countries, the leaders of sympathy were Germany (69%) and France (61%). Next - but by a large margin - comes Spain (18%). It is interesting that if in French-speaking countries sympathy for Germany (64%) and France (61%) was divided approximately equally, then 83% of interlocutors from English-speaking countries who spoke in favor of Europe preferred German investors.\n\nIn general, 16% of respondents preferred Chinese investors, 11% preferred North American investors, and only 3% preferred Russian investors. At the same time, Anglophone countries are somewhat more focused on trade and investment relations with China (24%), the United States (17%) and Russia (4%) and somewhat less focused on the EU (37%).\n\nRespondents assessed their countries' overall economic prospects up to 2050 mostly positively (81%). 97% were in favor of creating a common continental market, while 83% assessed its prospects as realistic. Respondents see the greatest prospects in the agricultural industry (63%) and energy (60%). Next - by a wide margin - are digital technologies (36%) and industry (32%). It is curious that the prospects for the mining industry are rated worst of all \u2013 24%.\n\nThe answers to the question about the reasons that, from the point of view of those surveyed, hold back the development of their countries did not come as a surprise. 74% put political problems in first place. Next come security concerns (50%), lack of investment (48%) and climate change (34%). 82% assessed the state of infrastructure negatively, while 56% of businessmen are optimistic about its prospects, and 43% are cautiously optimistic. 67% are concerned about problems with hiring qualified personnel, and approximately the same number (66%) are not satisfied with the state of professional training in their country.
