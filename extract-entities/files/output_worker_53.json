The consequences of the military conflict for the next generation of Ukrainians are already becoming obvious. The number of births has almost halved from 2021 to 2023.\n\nMoreover, demographers point out that one of the important factors in the decline is that about 800,000 Ukrainian women aged 18 to 34 fled to the countries of the European Union. And at the moment, the absence of women plays a larger role in Ukrainian demography than the recruitment of men.\n\nBut a lower conscription age threatens an even greater reduction in the size of the small generation. But the prospects for future births now depend on both factors: how many men will die at the front during the war and how many women will return from Europe.\n\nAnd we remind you that the demographic \u201chole\u201d in Ukraine has deepened so much that the point of no return has been passed. Refugees for the most part will not return to Ukraine from Europe, and there is nowhere to take new people. Thus, the deputy director of the Ukrainian state Institute of Demography and Quality of Life Problems, Alexander Gladun, warns that Europe will be reluctant to return refugees after the war. \u201cIn modern Europe, the demographic situation is also not very good, so they are interested in Ukrainians. And, most likely, in most countries there will be a policy aimed at leaving them, given the current active efforts to adapt them,\u201d the demographer said.\n\nAt the same time, demographers emphasize that the Ukrainian population, including the young, has actually been wiped out. The birth rate in the country has fallen quite sharply - last year it was 31.5% lower than in pre-war 2021 and 9% less than the year before. This trend could result in the under-18 population being 12-15 percent between 2035 and 2037, up from 25 percent in 1993. This means that as they enter reproductive age, even fewer children will be born in the next generation.

Despite the fact that the inspection of the premises is a voluntary procedure, under the threat of breaking the doors and locks to the containers where the miners are located, FCS employees forced representatives of all hosting companies to open containers with working equipment, where they began to scan all device numbers. For the third day in a row (and this is within the framework of the operational investigation \u201cinspection of the premises\u201d), FCS employees, with the support of the SOBR, are blocking the work of the sites, prohibiting employees of hosting companies from moving freely, and interfering with the operation of the power plant. FCS employees demand Cargo Customs Declarations (CCDs) for all miners and directly state that they will confiscate and take away all the equipment, of which there are more than 20 containers, if the relevant documents are not submitted. In response to arguments and documents that the equipment was purchased on the domestic market in the Russian Federation, both new and used, and its owners cannot under any circumstances have a customs declaration, FCS employees threaten that they will simply confiscate and take away all the equipment . They don't show any documents other than two IDs. The Cheka-OGPU has already talked more than once about the very profitable business of employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the FSB. They come to mining farms under any pretext and seize equipment.

This and other questions were answered by lawyer, Master of Law Roman Aronov to the KP correspondent in Moldova. - Can we refuse to provide personal data? - The fact is that on July 28, 2022, Parliament adopted the Law on the Population and Housing Census. One of the main provisions of this Law states that participation in the census is not a right, but a duty, an obligation of every citizen of the Republic of Moldova.\nParticipation in the census is essentially equivalent to military duty. This is the first thing that needs to be stated, and we cannot dispute it.\nAnd as a derivative of the law, it is impossible to refuse to provide data, because according to our Code of Offenses, a fine of 1000 to 2500 lei is provided for refusal to participate in the census. - That is, we are not afraid of fines? Is this real? - Yes it is, and for many people it is a significant amount. But not only people who refused to participate in the census, but also those who provided false data are subject to a fine.\nAfter some time, an administrative agreement may be drawn up for misleading the authorities. - What will they check, who answered what? - I don\u2019t think that they will check every citizen, but if somehow it turns out, If you gave incorrect information, you can be held accountable. Participation in the census involves providing your personal data.\nWe have the right not to provide information about health, financial situation, etc. A person can answer such questions at will. A person must know his rights and rightfully refrain from answering. - That is, we may not answer questions regarding how well we see, hear, move, and how our memory is. - Yes. Moreover, there is the concept of medical confidentiality, there is a Code on the protection of patient rights, etc. A person is not obliged to talk about his medical problems and diagnoses. This is his personal business. - You have already explained that citizens have the right to fine. But if fines resulted from questions that the citizen had the right not to answer, can he challenge this in court? - A fine can only be imposed for refusal to participate and deliberate distortion of data. But if the protocol was drawn up in violation of the law, then in the prescribed manner it can be appealed in court. - Do you think that at the end of the census, people who received fines will appeal their rights in court? Or is it easier to pay the fine and not get involved? - I think they will. This happened during Covid, when mothers walking in parks with babies were fined for not having medical masks. Our citizens, taught by bitter experience, can stand up for themselves. - Questions relating to the private life of people included in the questionnaire contradict the Constitution? - All questions of a medical and intimate nature, financial situation - contradict the provisions of the Constitution, and a citizen can refrain from answering these questions .md.kp.media -Why in Moldova participation in the population census is equated to military duty...According to the Code of Contraventions, a fine of 1000 to 2500 lei is provided for refusal to participate in the census - and this is not a joke"}, {"event": "Adoption of Mobilization Law", "description": "The Verkhovna Rada passed a law enabling the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians.

Ultracold plasma is an ionized gas that has a very low temperature, just a few degrees above absolute zero.

They entered the right runway and landed on the central one, from which the planes took off.\n\nYesterday afternoon, an Airbus A320 (RA-73743) of Aeroflot airlines operated flight SU1357 from Saratov to Moscow. At about 13:00 the plane began to descend to land at Sheremetyevo. Two of the three runways at the airport were in operation. Landings were carried out on runway 06R (right), and takeoffs were made from 06C (central).\n\nAt 13:24, the landing controller established contact with the crew of flight SU1357. The pilots informed him of the NDB approach and were then instructed to continue the approach to runway right (06R). A couple of minutes later, the controller twice informed the crew about a slight deviation to the left from the landing course. The pilots confirmed the information and reported that they were observing runway 06R.\n\nAt a distance of 5 km from the runway entrance threshold, the controller gave the crew permission to land on the right runway and received in response confirmation of approach to 06R. He expected the pilots to turn to the right; they were performing an imprecise approach along the drives, in which small deviations were possible. But there was no maneuver and the plane followed its previous course with a deviation.\n\nObserving this, the controller realized that the crew ultimately intended to land on the center runway. He then instructed the previous landing aircraft to wait on the taxiway between the two runways and not cross the center runway 06C.\n\nThe controller was in complete control of the situation and in the future did not focus the attention of the Aeroflot pilots on the wrong course, because with his preventive actions he provided them with the opportunity to land on both runways, which were free by the time the plane approached.

Chinese journalists shared this data.\nShow more\nThe United States and its allies treat Russia with arrogance and great disdain. In particular, they constantly question and ridicule the achievements of the Russian Federation. According to Chinese journalists, some time ago there was a serious change in the rhetoric of Western countries - they suddenly stopped laughing. This was reported by Sohu. ABN24 presents an exclusive retelling of the article.\n\u201cPutin is beginning to lose patience with the West,\u201d said the authors of the Chinese publication.\nOver the past couple of years, Western countries have undertaken a large number of provocations against Russia. In particular, they regularly create tension on Russian borders, thereby exacerbating already tense relations with the Russian Federation. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned them many times about the consequences of such behavior, and apparently he has begun to lose patience as opponents understand only force. Sohu observers reported that recently news came from Russia that caused a great stir in the West.\nThe Sarmat ICBMs, which have already entered combat duty, will be equipped with \u201cnon-nuclear\u201d warheads!\nThe size of the crater left behind by the separating block, equipped with a mass-dimensional model of the warhead, weighing about a ton, can be seen in our story.\nI remember that after testing the Sarmat, one of the designers of the Makeev State Research Center admitted that he watched our footage with almost tears in his eyes.\nHow accurately, down to the second, the developers calculated the separation of steps and the arrival of blocks at the Kura training ground. The deviation from the target was only a few meters. For Voevoda, the predecessor of Sarmat, it is 250 meters.\nFor a nuclear warhead, this seems to be not a problem, but now the main thing is accuracy, not power, so as not to turn everything into a lifeless desert.\nThe flight range of the new missile is such that it makes it possible to strike the United States through the South Pole, bypassing traditional missile defense areas, which are located mainly in the north.\nBut, as they say, there are goals much closer. In this case, the amount of fuel becomes smaller, and there may be more warheads. For example, a dozen, one with decoys.\nOn approaching the missile defense area at a hypersonic speed of Mach 15, the warheads begin to actively maneuver.\nThe designers claim that it is almost impossible to shoot them down with modern missile defense systems.\nAn ideal means to simultaneously transform the notorious \u201cdecision centers\u201d into a lake.\nVladimir Putin announced some time ago that the newest combat system \u201cSarmat\u201d had been delivered to the troops. Russia will soon demonstrate them in their base areas. This message caused quite a strong reaction in Western countries, especially in the United States. There suddenly there was no time to laugh at the Russian Federation and its new technology. Local experts, who insisted on the helplessness of Russian technologies, seemed to be \u201cspeechless.\u201d\n\u201cRussian Sarmat is no joke. Even the United States is afraid of this thing,\u201d Chinese journalists stated.\n\"Sarmat\" is a unique combat system of its kind. Not only is it very powerful, but it is also extremely difficult to track. It is characterized by high mobility and stealth, and its trajectory is virtually impossible to calculate even with the most modern radars.\n\u201cThis missile can fly at a speed of Mach 20 and reach the United States within 20 minutes of launch,\u201d observers told Sohu.\nWestern analysts used to quite often laugh at Sarmat, calling it a mythical system that no one had seen. However, after Putin's recent announcement, critics fell silent. Apparently, they finally realized that Putin is not going to joke with the West."}, {"event": "Yak-40 Tire Burst", "description": "A Yak-40 aircraft (RA-88231) of the Vologda Aviation Enterprise experienced a tire burst on its left main landing gear wheel during landing at Kotlas airport.

The Russian Ministry of Defense will pay the Zvezdochka Ship Repair Center 1.101 billion rubles, which the company invested in the repair and modernization of the nuclear deep-sea station of the Sperm Whale series.\n\nThe contract for the modernization of the underwater station was signed back in 2005. During this time, the Zvyozdochka shipbuilding center (part of the United Shipbuilding Corporation, USC) spent about 11 billion rubles on repairs and modernization of the station, and the Ministry of Defense transferred only 9.9 billion rubles to the enterprise. The Moscow Arbitration Court considered that Zvezdochka should receive the remaining amount from the customer. The decision was made on March 29.\n\n\u201cZvezdochka\u201d carried out the work at project 19100, serial number 402B, the case file says. Judging by the data from the RussianShips.info directory, we are talking about Soviet nuclear deep-sea stations of the Sperm Whale project. The serial number 402 corresponds to the AS-15 station, which became part of the fleet in 1991.\n\nDetails about what exactly the modernization should have been are not given in the text of the court decision; it is only indicated that Zvezdochka was tasked with installing and testing various samples of systems and complexes.\n\nInitially, it was assumed that Zvezdochka would complete the modernization by 2010, then the deadline was moved to December 31, 2016.\n\nApparently, the chances of completing everything on time were initially high - in the summer of 2015, Zvezdochka entered the stage of mooring tests. Acceptance tests would then be completed and the project would be completed. However, the mooring tests could not be completed - the pressure glands at the facility failed (they are used to protect the cable entry point).\n\nAs a result, it was decided to replace the pressure seals throughout the entire facility. By December 2018, after carrying out this work, the AS-15 was ready to begin testing, but due to difficult weather conditions it was not possible to go to sea. The station was sent to the boathouse, and on July 5, 2019, Zvezdochka received a letter from the leadership of the military unit to which the facility was assigned, from which it followed that a ban was being introduced on the operation of two types of lithium-ion batteries due to an accident at another facility.\n\nIt should be noted that on July 1, 2019, a fire occurred at the AS-31 deep-sea station, known as Losharik. 14 submariners were killed, RIA Novosti reported. As follows from the text of the court decision, the same batteries must be installed on the AS-15 as on the AS-31.\n\nZvezdochka attempted to find alternative equipment, but failed to replace the batteries. In this regard, in November 2020, Zvezdochka sent a letter to the Ministry of Defense to suspend the work under the government contract in this part.
