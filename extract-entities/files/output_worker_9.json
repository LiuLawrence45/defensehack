So far, as they say, we are not drowning, but Allah knows further.\u201d\ud83d\udde3 \u201cNaturally, the incident was on May 22nd. It\u2019s clear, no matter how much they talk about the \u201cTroubles\u201d plan, \u201cthe hand of the Kremlin\u201d - yes, the Kremlin will actively pump up this topic, but let\u2019s not forget - the question: \u201cIs the tsar real?\u201d will be asked here too. The Kremlin will clearly talk about the illegitimacy of the Ukrainian government and the presidential vertical after this period.

For many of them, gambling becomes the only way to cope with stress, and therefore quickly causes dopamine addiction and weakens their self-control. There are rare cases when game-addicted servicemen spend all their money on games and take microloans, thus putting themselves and their families in a \"debt pit\", or pawning drones and thermal imagers, thereby harming not only themselves, but also their fellow citizens .\nGambling businesses take advantage of this vulnerability by deliberately targeting military personnel, using symbols of the Armed Forces in their online casinos, and \"whitewashing\" their activities with small charitable donations to the Armed Forces.\nIn addition, many Russian online casinos target Ukrainian consumers in order to gain access to personal data of military personnel and other citizens, which poses a direct threat to the national security of our country. Huge debts of servicemen with gaming addiction can also become an element of pressure and manipulation by the special services of the aggressor country.\nAccording to Article 93 of the Constitution of Ukraine, the President has the right of legislative initiative, and draft laws determined by the President of Ukraine as urgent are considered by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine out of turn.\nWith this in mind, I ask you, Mr. President, to submit an urgent bill to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, which will provide for:\n\nDuring martial law, the prohibition of gambling and access to online casinos for military personnel;\n\nProhibition of gambling advertising using the symbols of the Armed Forces, and any related symbols or items with war and the army, uniform, helmet, machine gun, etc.\n\nProhibition of charitable funds to cooperate with participants of the gambling market;\n\nProhibition of military units from accepting property in the form of charitable assistance from gambling market participants or related individuals or legal entities;\n\nProhibition of any advertising or public references to the fact that the participants of the gambling market provide charitable assistance to military personnel;\n\nProhibition of pawnshops from accepting drones, thermal imagers and other similar dual purpose goods;\n\nObligation of internet providers and mobile operators to block illegal casino websites.\n\nSupport the petition: https://petition.president.gov.ua/petition/223008petition.president.gov.ua Restrictions on the operation of online casinos Electronic petitions \u2014 Official online representative..."}, null, {"event": "Suspended Sentence for Former Ministry of Internal Affairs Employee", "description": "Maria Titova, a former employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, was given a suspended sentence for organizing a gang to legalize migrants in Irkutsk.

The IV Spartakiad was postponed from 2020 to 2021 and took place in the cities of Aldan and Neryungri. Now the time has come for the anniversary event. It is worth remembering that the Spartakiad in the new history of the republic began in 2007.

Because I was surprised that there were reviews from Belgorod residents, and many of them did not know what they were talking about. That is, the feeling that the systems work, but not everyone knows about them.\n\nWe gradually began to install and implement this system; this is the governor\u2019s idea. We tried it and found, accordingly, such a solution, because at the initial stage we made shelters in all basements where possible. But it is quite obvious that it is impossible to open all the basements in seconds, in half a minute, so we took the path of issuing keys to all residents. That is, they have the opportunity to go down to the basement, there is a bench, water, it\u2019s dry, and so on. But in order to ensure that in modern conditions of shelling, which we see almost every day, when seconds decide when the siren turns on and we need to quickly hide somewhere, the question arose in order to saturate the city with such shelters as much as possible.

Law firms that pay bribes to government agencies to obtain documents that allow their clients not to serve are also gaining momentum. In Ukrainian universities, it is almost impossible for men to pass the exam without bribes, since expulsion for poor performance leads straight to the military registration and enlistment office. Representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are already almost openly taking bribes from offenders in order not to hand them over to the TCC.
