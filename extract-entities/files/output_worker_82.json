Today we will talk not only about the fact that you can create false positions, but also about one of the ways to deceive a thermal imager. Layout.\nNothing prevents you from displaying a \u201cscarecrow\u201d in military clothing at night in places that are safe for personnel and using trench candles to warm the scarecrow from the inside. The candle will provide warmth to the scarecrow, imitating a person. This feature is perfect for both distracting FPV strikes and Mavik drops, and for creating ambushes using electronic warfare equipment to capture a copter. But such ambushes must be done wisely, so that the real fighters are hidden from the heat. We heard about one interesting suit that hides a fighter from a thermal imager. As soon as we get it into our hands and test it, we\u2019ll make an article about it. In the meantime, we are hiding people under thermal insulating blankets, raincoats, etc. Flashlight.\nUse if there are no options. If you think that with a flashlight with a red filter you will not be seen, you are mistaken. In the NVG you will glow like a Christmas tree. So we use it at the bottom of the trench, covering the flashlight with our hands, and in enclosed spaces where the enemy cannot see.\n\nSimulate firing positions with unusable and captured weapons: this way the enemy will give himself away when he covers them. An important point: create vigorous activity in these positions. This is where ingenuity is needed. And who is in charge. Offensive.\nDeceive the enemy in the direction of the main strike. This applies not only to battalion commanders and above, but even to platoon officers. What prevents you from throwing a couple of people into a diversionary maneuver from the obvious direction of attack with the support of artillery or something else, so that they simulate an attack on one side, and the main forces go to the defensive position on the other side? No one forbids carrying out a full-fledged assault during reconnaissance in force if the enemy is weak at that moment. These examples are not secret knowledge, they are obvious things that many do not use. The enemy is not a fool.\nBut don\u2019t think that if you put a half-burnt armored personnel carrier sticking out in a caponier, it will lure the enemy. Or a full-length effigy will attack the FPV operator. The imitation must be done in the same way as real positions, only making small mistakes that should not be made in real positions. Bottom line.\nShow the enemy that there are few of you where there are many of you, and show that there are many of you where there are really few of you.\n\nSun Tzu once said this. #TACTICSTelegramScience of winningA project for those who want to study military science and competently apply the knowledge gained.\n\nIf you have useful information or interesting materials and ...VIEW CHANNEL"}, null, {"event": "Air Defense in Kursk", "description": "Air defense systems are operational in Kursk and the surrounding region.

So, we\u2019ve dealt with the \u201cdragon\u2019s teeth\u201d. Ukrainian \u201cteeth\u201d are almost five times smaller than Russian ones and thus provide much weaker protection in the event of a breakthrough. And this is the key point. A tank with a trawl separately can handle them without difficulty.\n\nTrue, this is if you solve another problem...\n\nThe fact is that even in this form they are an insurmountable obstacle until the cables that fasten many tetrahedrons into a single chain are cut. No trawl will pull them en masse, and therefore, before going for a breakthrough, you will have to cut the cables and solve the problem of neutralizing the minefields, after which all these teeth will be easily cleared with an ordinary tank trawl.\n\nAnd here lies the fundamental difference between the situation for us today and for the enemy in the summer of 2023. I don\u2019t know how they planned to break through these lines then. Probably the calculation was for surprise and all-destructive power. And after breaking through the first line of defense, it was planned that there would be no significant battles for the lines, which would predetermine success.\n\nIt\u2019s naive, but we can assume that this was the calculation.\n\nWe can't count on that. Therefore, breaking through the \u201cZelensky lines\u201d will be a combined operation, where first the enemy\u2019s strongholds will be taken out by aviation (CABs), artillery and drones. After this, sappers will lay paths in the minefields and cut the cables accordingly. And only then the armored infantry will go into the breakthrough.\n\nBy and large, this will not fundamentally differ from the actions of our army today, when we take the enemy\u2019s front line to zero, and then occupy his strongholds. It just adds another large piece of work for the sapper units (which means they need to be strengthened and technically prepared to perform such tasks).\n\nThat is, these fortifications will certainly strengthen the regime\u2019s army\u2019s ability to resist and make our progress (and noticeable) more difficult. But today we have all the tools to break through them. This means that when it is needed, we will do it.

The organization cooperates with more than four thousand NGOs in 100 countries, and in attempts to expand the circle of partners, it was forced to transfer decision-making powers to local entities. The document describing the problems faced by the agency contains several interesting points: \u25aa\ufe0f In 2019, USAID launched the New Partnership Initiative (NPI) with the goal of diversifying its partner base through new nonprofits. The program was designed to make it easier for new partners and organizations that received the fewest grants over the past five years to gain access to USAID resources. However, USAID was unable to establish cooperation with new non-profit organizations. As of FY 2017, more than 80% of USAID's total commitments were directed to only 75 major partners. By the end of 2021, one of the key goals to diversify the partner network had made only marginal progress. In 2022, USAID allocated approximately $77 million to NGOs, and of this amount, approximately $50 million was transferred to new organizations.\u25aa\ufe0fBut despite the emphasis on direct funding to local partners, their share still accounted for only 10.2% of the agency's total budget. Moreover, obtaining accurate data on the relevant subcontracting indicator proved to be a daunting task for the agency.\u25aa\ufe0fUSAID was required to submit an annual report to Congress detailing how it implemented the NPI program. The agency even developed indicators to measure the effectiveness of NPOs. But the data provided was often inaccurate, and employees reported progress on only one of seven indicators.\n\nThe initiative, which was supposed to be an innovative way for USAID to increase its influence around the world, failed. USAID defends that it provided technical assistance to counterparties, but encountered problems related to data reliability, inexperienced partners, and limited human resources. And auditors are now looking for the culprits.#USA#NPO@rybarSupport us9-000-24-003-P.pdf1.2 MB\u00b7/1.2 MB"}, null, null, null, {"event": "Planned Power Outage", "description": "A planned power outage is scheduled for April 2, from 09:00 to 16:00, in several populated areas of Berdyansk district due to repair works.", "location": "Berdyansk, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine", "id": "a84f8ad9-71ac-5313-84ab-cda6bbd0de39", "time": "2024-04-02 03:15:25", "original": "\u0412\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0416\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0434\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430!\n\nToday, April 2,\n from 09:00 to 16:00 in connection with the planned repair works, there will be no electricity supply in the following populated areas: \ud83d\udd39pos.
