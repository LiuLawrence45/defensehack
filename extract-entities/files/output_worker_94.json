Yes, in war, losses are inevitable and military personnel treat this with understanding. But they will never understand the incompetence of the command and its consequence - unnecessary losses.\n\nAnd so a split occurs between those who fight for the Motherland and those who fight for stars, positions and the approving nod of the head of the highest authorities. Will this split lead to anything good? Vices do not correct themselves. They can only be corrected through willpower. Sometimes titanic.\n\nLook how many heroes we have at the front. Some see in this only the readiness for self-sacrifice, which is inherent in our people. This is true. But I also see in this the blunders of the command, because of which heroism became a mass phenomenon. But the fighter who voluntarily passed away saw a little more - he also saw the reluctance to correct this situation and the desire of his superiors to continue to rely on heroism rather than competence. This is also an unnecessary loss. And it is also due to the fact that commanders do not change their approach to planning and organizing operations.

It was they who for many years supported politicians, journalists, and public figures who hated Russia. We are talking not only about the events after 1991. Ukrainian nationalism was created as a weapon against Russia and was consistently supported by Austria-Hungary, Poland, Nazi Germany and Western countries. In 2014, the United States and European countries directly supported the organizers of the coup and put direct pressure on the President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych, preventing the use of force against the criminals\u2757\ufe0f Since the Euromaidan, there has been no improvement in living standards as a result of the signing of the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine, which was one of the goals of Euromaidan. Moreover, Ukrainian products are not allowed into EU markets if there is the slightest threat to their own producers.\n\nAfter the start of a special military operation, a flood of Western aid and weapons poured into Ukraine. At the time of publication of the book, the total amount of support, including the supply of weapons from Western countries to Ukraine, amounted to more than $300 billion. The main suppliers of weapons were those countries that supported and organized the Euromaidan. These facts leave no doubt about the role that the West prepared for Ukraine back during the Euromaidan: to be an instrument of containment of Russia.\n\n***\ud83d\udc49Full electronic version of the book (pdf)"}, null, null, null, null, null, null, {"event": "Peskov Responds to Biden's Insult", "description": "Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson, condemned US President Joe Biden's derogatory remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling them 'disgusting and shameful'.", "location": "Moscow, Russia", "id": "3a252b14-13cb-59b9-9ffb-1628e3058b22", "time": "2024-02-22 09:59:03", "original": "\u201cIT\u2019S DISGUSTING AND SHAMEFUL!\u201d - Peskov on the words of Biden, who called Putin a \u201ccrazy son of a bitch\u201d @crimea24new"}, {"event": "Air Force Destroys UAVs", "description": "The Air Force successfully destroyed 8 out of 10 'Shahed' type UAVs in multiple regions, including Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kharkiv.", "location": "Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Ukraine", "id": "3a28b6cc-9541-5026-bbce-b5ed21c8befb", "time": "2024-02-22 06:07:02", "original": "This night, the Air Force destroyed 8 out of 10 \"Shahed\" type UAVs in Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv regions."}, {"event": "Vladimir Putin's Flight on Tu-160MS", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin flew on the Tu-160MS Soldier of Luck strategic bomber-missile carrier, with footage of the event published by the Kremlin.", "location": "Moscow, Moscow Oblast, Russia", "id": "3a2c18af-48f7-5508-a884-493e19c06d0e", "time": "2024-02-22 16:04:02", "original": "The Kremlin published footage of Vladimir Putin's flight on the Tu-160MS Soldier of Luck strategic bomber-missile carrier.
