But if we are to pose the problem of responsibility for starting the war, then first we need to answer the key question: who ensured the Nazis\u2019 rise to power, who guided them along the path to global catastrophe? The entire pre-war history of Germany shows that the \u201cnecessary\u201d political course was ensured by controlled financial shocks, into which, by the way, the world was plunged even today. The key structures that determined the strategy for the post-war development of the West were the central financial institutions of Great Britain and the United States - the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve System (FRS) - and related financial and industrial organizations, which set the goal of establishing absolute control over the German financial system in order to manage political processes in Central Europe. The following stages can be distinguished in the implementation of this strategy: 1st: from 1919 to 1924. - preparing the ground for massive American financial injections into the German economy; 2nd: from 1924 to 1929 - establishing control over the German financial system and financial support for National Socialism; 3rd: from 1929 to 1933 - provoking and unleashing a deep financial and economic crisis and ensuring the Nazis\u2019 rise to power; 4th: from 1933 to 1939 \u2013 financial cooperation with the Nazi regime and support for its expansionist foreign policy aimed at preparing and unleashing a new world war. At the first stage, the main levers for ensuring the penetration of American capital into Europe were war debts and the closely related problem of German reparations. After the formal entry of the United States into the First World War, they provided loans to the allies (primarily England and France) in the amount of $8.8 billion. The total amount of military debt, including loans provided by the United States in 1919-1921, amounted to more than 11 billion dollars. The debtor countries tried to solve their problems at the expense of Germany, imposing on it a huge amount and extremely difficult conditions for paying reparations. The resulting flight of German capital abroad and refusal to pay taxes led to a state budget deficit that could only be covered through the mass issue of unbacked stamps. The result of this was the collapse of the German currency - the \u201cgreat inflation\u201d of 1923, amounting to 578,512%, when one dollar was worth 4.2 trillion marks. German industrialists began to openly sabotage all measures to pay reparation obligations, which ultimately provoked the well-known \u201cRuhr crisis\u201d - the Franco-Belgian occupation of the Ruhr in January 1923. This is exactly what the Anglo-American ruling circles were waiting for, so that, having allowed France to get bogged down in the planned adventure, Having proven her inability to solve the problem, take the initiative into her own hands. US Secretary of State Hughes pointed out: \u201cWe must wait until Europe is ripe to accept the American proposal.\u201d The new project was developed in the depths of J.P. Morgan and Co.? on the instructions of the head of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman. It was based on the ideas of Dresdner Bank representative Hjalmar Schacht, formulated by him back in March 1922 at the suggestion of John Foster Dulles (future Secretary of State in the cabinet of President Eisenhower), legal adviser to President William Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference. Dulles handed this note to the main confidant of J.P. Morgan and Co., after which J.P. Morgan recommended J. Schacht to M. Norman, and the latter to the Weimar rulers. In December 1923, J. Schacht would become the manager of the Reichsbank and play a vital role in bringing Anglo-American and German financial circles closer together. In the summer of 1924, this project, known as the \u201cDawes Plan\u201d (named after the chairman of the committee of experts that prepared it, an American banker, director of one of the Morgan group banks), was adopted at the London Conference. It provided for a halving of the payment of reparations and resolved the issue of sources of covering them. However, the main task was to ensure favorable conditions for American investment, which was only possible with the stabilization of the German mark. To achieve this, the plan included providing Germany with a large loan in the amount of $200 million, half of which went to the Morgan banking house. At the same time, Anglo-American banks established control not only over the transfer of German payments, but also over the budget, the monetary circulation system and, to a large extent, the country's credit system. By August 1924, the old Deutsche Mark had been replaced by a new one, Germany's financial position had stabilized, and, as researcher G. D. Preparta wrote, the Weimar Republic was prepared for \u201cthe most spectacular economic bailout in history, followed by the most bitter harvest in world history.\u201d \"-\"American blood poured into the financial veins of Germany in an unstoppable stream.\" The consequences of this were not slow to reveal themselves. Firstly, due to the fact that annual reparation payments were used to cover the amount of debts paid by the allies, the so-called \u201cabsurd Weimar circle\u201d developed. The gold that Germany paid in the form of war reparations was sold, mortgaged and disappeared in the United States, from where it was planned to be returned in the form of \u201caid\u201d to Germany, which gave it to England and France, and they, in turn, paid them the US war debt. The latter, having imposed interest on it, again sent it to Germany. As a result, everyone in Germany lived on debt, and it was clear that if Wall Street called in its loans, the country would suffer complete bankruptcy. Secondly, although formally loans were issued to ensure payments, it was actually about restoring the country\u2019s military-industrial potential. The fact is that the Germans paid for the loans with shares of enterprises, so American capital began to actively integrate into the German economy. The total amount of foreign investment in German industry for 1924-1929. amounted to almost 63 billion gold marks (30 billion were loans), and the payment of reparations amounted to 10 billion marks. 70% of financial revenues were provided by US bankers, mostly J.P. Morgan's banks. As a result, already in 1929, German industry reached second place in the world, but to a large extent it was in the hands of leading American financial and industrial groups. Thus, I.G. Farbenindustry, this main supplier of the German military machine, which financed 45% of Hitler\u2019s election campaign in 1930, was under the control of Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil. The Morgans, through General Electric, controlled the German radio and electrical industry represented by AEG and Siemens (by 1933, 30% of AEG shares belonged to General Electric), through the ITT communications company - 40% of the German telephone network, in addition to owned 30% of the shares of the aircraft manufacturing company Focke-Wulf. Opel was controlled by General Motors, owned by the Dupont family. Henry Ford controlled 100% of the shares of the Volkswagen concern. In 1926, with the participation of the Rockefeller bank Dillon Reed and Co.? the second largest industrial monopoly in Germany after I.G. Farbenindustry arose - the metallurgical concern \u201cVereinigte Stahlwerke\u201d (Steel Trust) of Thyssen, Flick, Wolf and Vogler and others. American cooperation with the German military-industrial complex was so intense and pervasive, that by 1933, key sectors of German industry and such large banks as Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Donat Bank, etc. were under the control of American financial capital. At the same time, the political force that was called upon to play a decisive role was being prepared role in the implementation of Anglo-American plans. We are talking about financing the Nazi party and A. Hitler personally. As former German Chancellor Br\u00fcning wrote in his memoirs, starting in 1923, Hitler received large sums from abroad. It is unknown where they came from, but they arrived through Swiss and Swedish banks. It is also known that in 1922, in Munich, A. Hitler met with the US military attache in Germany, Captain Truman Smith, who wrote a detailed report about it to the Washington authorities (the Office of Military Intelligence), in which he spoke highly of Hitler. It was through Smith that Ernst Franz Zedgwik Hanfstaengl (Putzi), a graduate of Harvard University, who played an important role in the formation of A. Hitler as a politician, provided him with significant financial support and provided him with acquaintances and connections with high-ranking British figures, was introduced into Hitler\u2019s circle of acquaintances. Hitler was being prepared for big politics, however, while prosperity reigned in Germany, his party remained on the periphery of public life. The situation changes dramatically with the onset of the crisis. Since the autumn of 1929, after the collapse of the American stock exchange provoked by the Federal Reserve, the third stage of the strategy of Anglo-American financial circles begins to be implemented. The Fed and the Morgan banking house decide to stop lending to Germany, inspiring a banking crisis and economic depression in Central Europe. In September 1931, England abandoned the gold standard, deliberately destroying the international payment system and completely cutting off the financial oxygen of the Weimar Republic. But a financial miracle occurs with the NSDAP: in September 1930, as a result of large donations from Thyssen, I.G. Farbenindustry\" and Kirdorf, the party receives 6.4 million votes, takes second place in the Reichstag, after which generous infusions from abroad intensify. J. Schacht becomes the main link between the largest German industrialists and foreign financiers. On January 4, 1932, a meeting between the largest English financier M. Norman and A. Hitler and von Papen took place, at which a secret agreement was concluded on financing the NSDAP. American politicians the Dulles brothers were also present at this meeting, which their biographers do not like to mention. And on January 14, 1933, Hitler met with Schroeder, Papen and Kepler, where Hitler\u2019s program was fully approved. It was here that the issue of transferring power to the Nazis was finally resolved, and on January 30, Hitler became Reich Chancellor. Now the implementation of the fourth stage of the strategy begins. The attitude of the Anglo-American ruling circles towards the new government became extremely favorable. When Hitler refused to pay reparations, which naturally called into question the payment of war debts, neither England nor France made any claims against him regarding payments. Moreover, after the trip of J. Schacht, who was again appointed head of the Reichsbank, to the USA in May 1933 and his meeting with the president and the largest bankers from Wall Street, America allocated new loans to Germany totaling $1 billion. And in June, During a trip to London and a meeting with M. Norman, Schacht seeks to provide an English loan of 2 billion dollars and reduce and then stop payments on old loans. Thus, the Nazis got what previous governments could not achieve. In the summer of 1934, Britain concluded the Anglo-German transfer agreement, which became one of the foundations of British policy towards the Third Reich, and by the end of the 30s, Germany became England's main trading partner. Schr\u00f6der's bank became Germany's main agent in Great Britain, and in 1936 its New York branch merged with the Rockefeller house to create the investment bank Schr\u00f6der, Rockefeller & Co., which Times magazine called \"the economic propagandist of the Berlin-Axis.\" Rome\". As Hitler himself admitted, he conceived his four-year plan on the financial basis of a foreign loan, so it never gave him the slightest alarm. In August 1934, the American Standard Oil purchased 730 thousand acres of land in Germany and built large oil refineries that supplied the Nazis with oil. At the same time, the most modern equipment for aircraft factories was secretly delivered to Germany from the United States, where production of German aircraft would begin. Germany received a large number of military patents from the American companies Pratt and Whitney, Douglas, and Bendix Aviation, and the Junkers 87 was built using American technology. By 1941, when World War II was raging, American investment in the German economy amounted to $475 million. Standard Oil invested $120 million, General Motors $35 million, ITT $30 million, and Ford \u201c- 17.5 million. The closest financial and economic cooperation between the Anglo-American and Nazi business circles was the background against which the policy of appeasing the aggressor was pursued in the 30s, which led to the Second World War. Today, when the world's financial elite has begun to implement the plan \"Great Depression - 2\" with the subsequent transition to the \"new world order\", identifying its key role in organizing crimes against humanity becomes a paramount task. \u00a9Dutov Andrey FRIENDS SUBSCRIBE to the channel \"TALES OF RUSSIA \u201cEvery day I post articles that you won\u2019t read anywhere else. link https://vk.com/russkazi"}, null, {"event": "Briefing on Operational Situation", "description": "A briefing was held on the operational situation from March 18 to 20, providing an update on the current state of affairs.", "location": "Gorlovka, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine", "id": "0c436826-7fb6-5c08-b18a-fc164f471a61", "time": "2024-03-21 07:34:34", "original": "Briefing on the operational situation for the period from March 18 to 20https://vk.com/video-66833222_456300765VkVideo by Gorlovka Self-Defensevk video"}, {"event": "Estonia Provides Military Aid to Ukraine", "description": "Estonia will provide a new package of military aid to Ukraine, worth 20 million euros.

Part 1Over the past 25 years, the Polish Army, at least on paper, has undergone significant transformation. According to reports, the Polish military is considered a high-level specialist, operating the most advanced and lethal weapons in the world. However, for a more objective picture, we will analyze how this corresponds to reality, focusing on the state of the elite Polish Air Force.\n\nIt turned out that the most pressing problem of the Polish Army was its qualitative and quantitative composition. Thus, in recent years there has been an outflow of officers. This is a consequence of the aging of the nation.\n\nLet's move on to the numbers. Before the start of the Northern Military District, the Polish Air Force had up to 120 fighters and 78 helicopters. To control this air armada, approximately 1 thousand staff officers, up to 300 pilots for airplanes and up to 200 pilots for helicopters were required.\n\nOver the past two years, the arsenal of the Polish Armed Forces has been seriously updated. Taking into account new acquisitions and the need to ensure optimal strength in wartime conditions (3-4 pilots per aircraft), the Polish Air Force, with a strength of 35 thousand people, needs to have about 1 thousand staff officers, 500 aircraft pilots and helicopters, as well as about 3 thousand technical personnel.\n\nThese calculations are confirmed by the new Polish \u201cInstructions for the training and admission of aviation specialists to operate aircraft of the Polish Armed Forces.\u201d\n\nThe document notes an important aspect: the Polish Armed Forces are required to have: 2222 officers, 2121 sergeants and 1121 privates.\n\nHowever, it should be recognized that the Polish military is far from achieving such indicators. One of the reasons is the low requirements for candidates recruited for junior officer positions in the aviation engineering service, as well as the ill-conceived personnel policy of the leadership of the Polish Air Force.\n\nAll article material on our website (Part 1.

Nikolai Kharitonov\u2019s best result was 12.9% in Djibouti and Somalia, and Leonid Slutsky scored 7.14% in Guinea-Bissau and 12.9% at one of the polling stations in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nExtra-system opposition forces campaigned to vote for Davankov or spoil the ballots, which influenced the results in some countries. The New People candidate won in Austria, Great Britain, Hungary, Poland, Denmark and other European countries, as well as Israel, Argentina and Vietnam. Moreover, at the peak of the protest wave, Montenegro (69% and 19% of spoiled ones), Serbia (67% and 19%) and the Czech Republic (60% and 21%) turned out to be popular among relocants. For the same reason, Davankov won part of the electoral commissions in Kazakhstan, Turkey and Armenia.\n\nVladimir Putin won at polling stations in the USA, Germany and France. They also voted for the president in China, India, Greece, Moldova, and most countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa. Records were set in Turkmenistan (95.7%), Tajikistan (93.9%) and Belarus (87.7%). Uruguay has the only tie: 43% of the vote.\n\nThe results turned out to be unexpected: despite the unprecedented information war, the activation of \u201coutside the system\u201d, and a large number of relocants of the latest wave, Vladimir Putin won in many Western countries. At the same time, in 2018, the president\u2019s result in foreign sections was 85%.

But she was last seen in public in December 2023. Even at the Movement Day celebration on March 1st, during Yoon Sogyeol's speech when he confessed his love to the Japanese, Kim Gunhee did not stand next to her husband.\n\nIf the reasons for Kate Middleton's disappearance are her operation (or a conspiracy by the royal family), then Kim Gun-hee's absence can be explained by purely political reasons. In December, she was last seen in public, and already in January there was a scandal with a Dior bag. In the released hidden camera video, the first lady was given a luxury bag worth three million won, which violated anti-corruption laws. The funny thing is that the video was published back in November, but the scandal occurred only a few months later.\n\nAfter that, as they say, a small split in the ruling \u201cPower of the People\u201d party and the presidential administration, pressure from the opposition, and falling ratings began. The entire South Korean press was noisy, new details of what happened appeared almost every day. In general, a full-fledged political scandal.\n\nAnd now, in order not to irritate the people once again (although, it seems, everyone has already forgotten about the scandal), political strategists and the presidential administration decided not to show Kim Gonghinik. Don't forget, in South Korea there are parliamentary elections in April, and the president's falling ratings may reduce the chances of victory for the ruling party, so this decision is quite logical. @awaken_dragon"}, {"event": "Veterinary Department Report", "description": "The head of the Veterinary Department of St. Petersburg, Yuri Andreev, reported to the Legislative Assembly's standing commission on ecology and environmental management about the department's work in 2023.
