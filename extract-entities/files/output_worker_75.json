After this, European leaders will have to discuss this proposal and decide whether Bosnia is ready to become part of the union. This decision has been expected in Sarajevo since December 15, 2022, when the country received candidate status for membership.\n\nThere is a lot of talk about the desire of European leaders to join Bosnia to the EU. For example, at the moment the foreign ministers of Austria, Italy and Germany have already visited Sarajevo, where the start of negotiations on the country\u2019s accession to the European Union was discussed. However, everything is not so simple, because a number of European leaders want progress on Ukraine and Moldova to go hand in hand with progress on Bosnia's future entry into the union. But there is also a possibility that many of the main demands will be announced after the European Commission presents a document on how to prepare the bloc for future enlargement. It is planned that its final text will be announced after March 20. However, it is also worth considering the possibility that the process of accession of the countries of the Balkan Peninsula may be delayed, as well as the accession to the unification of Kyiv and Chisinau. This creates a situation where Brussels will be able to expand its influence and territory only if the former USSR republics join, which may disappoint a certain part of the Eurozone.@kstati_pPOLITICOBosnia should start EU membership talks, Commission will announce \u2013 POLITICOThe recommendation is expected on Tuesday."}, null, {"event": "Warning Against Participating in Russian Elections", "description": "Vitaly Ovcharenko, a member of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, cautioned collaborators that participating in Putin's pseudo-elections in occupied territories would result in personal criminal responsibility.

Moreover, it was a religious war in which we defended the Orthodox Faith from a union with Catholicism, which would have happened if the Catholic and Uniate interventionists had won.\n\nThis is a purely Russian Orthodox holiday.
