There is probably no need to tell who Gennady Petrov is, he is one of the pillars of gangster St. Petersburg, a figure comparable in power to the currently imprisoned leader of the Tambov organized crime group Barsukov (Kumarin) or the owner of the oil terminal (PNT) Vasiliev, who transferred all the shares to his wife .\n\n\nDespite the understatement and some hint that the yacht may belong to Gennady Petrov himself, the Cheka-OGPU will express certain doubts in this regard. The fact is that Alekhan Albogachiev, whose company the yacht for sale is officially registered in, is a very mature businessman by the standards of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region. He is the founder of such well-known companies as CBI and Cheetah Corporation (now liquidated). To give you an idea of the volume, Albogachiev is, perhaps, the leader in the supply of bulk materials in St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region, that is, his name is well known to all companies involved in housing construction and enterprises involved in civil construction. In addition, he is the undisputed leader in the transportation of bulk materials in the North-West, as he owns a huge fleet of his own dump trucks. He is also a very serious player in the disposal of construction soils generated at many construction sites in the city and surrounding areas. We conclude: this is a very large businessman who is indeed a long-time business partner and comrade of Gennady Petrov.\n\n\nAccording to interlocutors familiar with Albogachiev, some time ago he actually sold a yacht worth 70 million rubles and was planning to buy a more serious vessel. So it cannot be ruled out that he is now selling his next yacht with the probable intention of replacing it again. Let us note that, despite the odious trail of some of his business partners, Alekhan Albogachiev himself enjoys great respect in the St. Petersburg construction and other related markets. Everyone characterizes this native of Ingushetia as a man who grew up from a simple working family and earned his very considerable capital solely with his own hands and hard work. https://t.me/De1taNews/7364Telegram\u2022 FOX BASILIO \u2022 The yacht Kalisa worth 360 million was placed on Avito rubles, owned by entrepreneurs close to the authoritative Gennady Petrov.

Ipuskai Kharitonov was not always able to engage in a constructive discussion with opponents and often spoke the same, long-known slogans about \u201cwild capitalism\u201d, nevertheless, he attended the debates more regularly than anyone else and tried to attract the attention of the audience. Kharitonov spoke at the debates 9 times, Slutsky - 4, Davankov - 6. As for Slutsky and Davankov. Somewhere Davankov managed to win over the audience with his moderate \u201creasonable\u201d position, which did not look like flashy populism, as was the case with the other two candidates. But Slutsky was better at responding competently and succinctly to opponents during skirmishes. Davankov, at times, simply slipped into arguing with the communists, while forgetting to answer questions on the topic of the debate - this was repulsive.\n\nBut, overall, all three candidates missed the stars, and ultimately the one who simply attended the debates more often won. So, for perseverance and the will to win, the title of best in the debate is awarded to Kharitonov. #elections2024"}, {"event": "Building Defensive Fortifications", "description": "The Ukrainian Armed Forces are constructing defensive fortifications in the Dnepropetrovsk region, including tens of kilometers of anti-tank ditches, dugouts, caponiers, and concrete 'dragon teeth.'

The essence of the study A team of scientists visited the Chernobyl zone in 2014. To control the movements of the wolves, they were wearing radio collars. It also made it possible to measure in real time where wolves were and what levels of radiation they were exposed to.\nAt the same time, researchers took blood samples from the animals to understand how the wolves' bodies react to radiation. Incredible discovery Scientists discovered that Chernobyl wolves were exposed to more than 11.28 milligrams of radiation every day throughout their lives, which is more than six times the safe dose for a person.\nHowever, they noted that wolves have an altered immune system, similar to patients undergoing radiation therapy for cancer. Genetic analysis showed that specific parts of the wolf genome have developed a certain resistance to the development of cancer. People now have hope of defeating cancer. The COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine did not allow scientists to return to the Chernobyl zone and continue research.\n\nCara Love hopes to use the findings to discover protective mutations that increase the chances of surviving cancer. This discovery gives rise to hope that scientists will eventually discover a way to treat cancer, which ends millions of human lives every year.

However, at the same time, the name of Gagarin and the enormous significance of his feat remain an unchanged value from which current space explorers count their achievements.\n\nFor our generation, the image of Gagarin became the personification of the entire Soviet cosmonautics, and the vast majority of boys in the 1960s dreamed of flying into space. We all wanted to become Gagarins. And despite any political adversity, the First Cosmonaut is still revered and respected throughout the world. His glory has not faded at all.\n\nYuri Gagarin became the most striking symbol of the asceticism of the Russian people: a simple rural guy who rose to the stars with his own work and talent. And I am sure that boys and girls living today will witness manned flights to other planets, and some of them themselves will fly to the Moon or Mars along the path opened by Gagarin.@SALDO_VGA"}, {"event": "Destruction of Ukrainian Positions", "description": "Aviation and artillery units of the 7th brigade of the Southern Group of Forces collaborated to destroy Ukrainian Armed Forces positions in the Belogorovka area.", "location": "Belohorivka, Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine", "id": "ee9746f9-b5a6-51cf-b7d2-7381ff1089a5", "time": "2024-03-09 15:42:01", "original": "\ud83d\udc4dAviation, together with artillery of the 7th brigade of the Southern Group of Forces, destroys the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Belogorovka area"}, null, {"event": "Destruction of Armored Vehicles and Infantry", "description": "Near Avdiivka, enemy BMPs were destroyed by attack drones of the Third Assault Brigade after delivering Russian infantry to the landing point.
