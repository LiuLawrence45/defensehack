Because, using the dollar as an instrument of armed struggle, there is no other way to say it, they raise doubts about the reliability of the American currency both as a settlement instrument in world trade and as a store of value. Large economies' dollar reserves are shrinking year after year. Not as fast as some would like, but they are decreasing - just as payments in the world economy in dollars are decreasing. Settlements in national currencies are growing: in yuan, in some currencies of Arab countries. In general, regardless of the events taking place in Europe, projects are emerging in Latin America to create their own currencies. It is no coincidence that in the Arab world they have long been talking about creating their own single currency, and in Asia they are talking about this. But if oil producers in leading Arab countries are now saying that they are ready to pay in yuan for oil, we have absolutely nothing to do with it.

The main goal is to consolidate efforts to harmonize interethnic relations. That is, it\u2019s clear, right?) Translated into Russian from the bureaucratic, in order to normalize interethnic relations in the Stavropol region, they created a council of young representatives of local diasporas at state expense. It's called putting out a fire with gasoline.\nAgain, diaspora leaders are engaged in youth and national politics in the Russian mono-ethnic region.\n\nTo harmonize interethnic relations, there are the following proven means:\n1. Ban and disbandment of diasporas of non-indigenous peoples of Russia.\n2. Tightening of migration policy.\n3. Strict punishment for all violators of the law, without any ridiculous actions like \u201cauthority representatives discussed the situation with diaspora leaders.\u201d\n4. In the Cossack region, hooligans can still be whipped in public.\n\nHere is a youth ethnic council that made a video glorifying diasporas, and not the unity of Russians and other indigenous peoples of Russia.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what one of its leaders, executive director of the Armenian national-cultural autonomy \u201cNAIRI\u201d, deputy chairman of the regional Youth Ethnic Council, member of the public council under the Stavropol Territory Committee on Nationalities and Cossacks Affairs Anton Vardanyan says about the work of this council: verbally this real help from the regional authorities, our committee. And not only we see, but the hall of the Palace of Culture and Sports of 1200 people can see this when we, for example, hold the regional Festival of Traditional Armenian Culture (that is, the regional authorities of Stavropol spend our taxes on festivals of non-indigenous peoples of Russia. I am not against a festival of Armenian or Azerbaijani culture, but at private, not state expense. Festivals of Russian or Tatar culture should be held at the expense of the state budget of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation.)\n\nMr. Vardanyan also received government grants for the import of migrants to the Stavropol region: we created a migrant assistance center \u201cAssistance\u201d. We worked not only with those coming from Armenia, but with absolutely everyone, regardless of nationality and religion, and helped many. Moreover, it is absolutely free: this is preparation for passing exams in the Russian language, Russian history, and the basics of legislation. It was very difficult and intense work; during the three months of the project, approximately 1,200 people passed through the center! Karachais, Greeks, Yezidis, Kurds, Jews, Ukrainians, Turkmens, Tajiks, Kazakhs applied. And the guy is really happy that he brought 1,200 guest workers to the Stavropol region . Question: why the hell do we need them?\nOf the nationalities he listed, only the Karachais are the indigenous people of Russia.\n\nIn fact, the leaders of the \u201cYouth Ethnic Council of the Stavropol Territory\u201d have latched onto state money and spend it on lobbying the interests of their diasporas.\n\nAnd in our country there are a gigantic number of absurd multinational councils and assemblies of the \u201cpeoples\u201d of Russia, which simply harm our country, protect the interests of diasporas, not promoting interethnic and interfaith harmony, but destroying it.\nAnd we spend a lot of government money on these hordes, which we could spend on reviving Russian culture or purchasing UAVs for the army."}, {"event": "Il-76 Crash", "description": "14 bodies were found at the crash site of an Il-76 near Ivanovo.
