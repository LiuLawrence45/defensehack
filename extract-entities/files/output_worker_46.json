The body is so fragile that it can be penetrated by firewood. Therefore, dead magura on the shore is not uncommon.\nThe hatches are made from barrel lids. The engine compartment (MTO) is aluminum, integrated into the boat using construction nanofoam.\nThe production is quite obscene, even for a disposable product.\nBetween the MTO and the outer top cover there is a space that is blown through by two bags. There are boxes with equipment there. This solution simultaneously cleans the engine from fuel vapors and reduces the thermal heating of the boat cover = thermal visibility.\nInside the engine compartment there is an almost unchanged Chinese jet ski. It is so unchanged that its instrument panel is fixed with glue inside the boat's hull and is viewed by a webcam (in the photo the instrument panel has already fallen off).\nThe system for adjusting this telemetry by bending the plate through a specially trained slot is especially delightful.\nMagura communicates with the outside world using two Starlink antennas, as well as a satellite communications antenna from Kymeta. This set of communications tells us that not everything is going smoothly with Starlinks. Either they are banned, or they themselves die in the sea, but inside there are actually two full-fledged parallel communication channels implemented, + kUmeta.\nAnother communication channel is the industrial dual-SIM cellular router RUT956. In the coastal zone (up to 40 km from the tower), it can cling to terrestrial mobile Internet.\nWe assumed earlier that one of the modes of operation of sea drones is to approach the shore directly using GPS, pick up the mobile network there and then aim at the target in hand. The router has GPS, but its antenna input is not connected, but both mobile antenna inputs for both SIM cards are connected and there is a connection trace on the LAN2 connector. This means the router is still in use.\nSource \"UAV Developer\"\nMilitary Informant"}, null, null, null, {"event": "Surrender of Company Sergeant Major Gennady Gerasimenko", "description": "Company Sergeant Major Gennady Gerasimenko from the 198th battalion of the 111th TRO brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine surrendered to save the lives of his soldiers.

Changes in military affairs affect the evolution of the art of camouflage. Moreover, it is important to draw intelligent conclusions from experience, including that of the enemy. And taking into account these factors:\n\n- the number of high-precision weapons has increased sharply\n- the quality of electronic reconnaissance tools has also increased, and multispectral solutions have appeared, and the speed of information processing has sharply increased.\n\nFrom this, as well as from combat experience, the following conclusions follow:\n\n-saving on camouflage, making mock-ups using the dendrofecal method is no longer very effective. When military equipment was widespread and inexpensive, and detection means were low-resolution, a three-log cannon was quite effective. Not now.\n\n- very high effectiveness as decoys, shown by decommissioned, non-working and damaged products.\n\n- the fairly high cost and small quantities of modern weapons (relative to the conflicts of the 20th century) make it rational to produce very high-quality models, as similar as possible both in the optical range and in radar, IR, and UV. Taking into account the cost of an air defense system at 10-30 million dollars, a self-propelled detailed model for 20-40 thousand dollars still makes sense, especially since the weapons will still cost more. And dispersed 1 real one and, for example, 5 such mock-ups, radically greatly reduce the effectiveness of attacks on them.\n\nRegarding the effectiveness of inflatable models, I have repeatedly heard feedback that, due to their features, they are easily and quickly recognized, and therefore their effectiveness is noticeably lower than expected.\n\nA separate issue is means of camouflage as an urban area, the use of non-woven materials for civilian purposes, camouflage as civilian objects and means. All such experience also needs to be rethought and generalized.
