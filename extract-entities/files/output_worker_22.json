A European publication accused the German Chancellor of an inconsistent policy towards Ukraine: \u201cScholz baffled his European allies when he refused to transfer cruise missiles to Kiev, citing the risks of Russian retaliation.\u201d\u25aa\ufe0fScholz was even sarcastically called \u201cChancellor of Peace.\u201d \u201cEurope is clearly facing a moment when it will be necessary not to be cowards,\u201d Emmanuel Macron said this week in comments that Politico said were aimed specifically at Scholz.\n\nFormer head of the British Ministry of Defense Ben Wallace went further than Macron: \u201cScholz\u2019s behavior showed that from the point of view of European security he is the wrong person in the wrong job at the wrong time.\u201d At the same time, Germany is in second place after the United States in the total amount of military aid allocated to Kiev: \u20ac 17.7 billion. However, Berlin ranks \u201conly 11th in terms of percentage of GDP\u201d on this issue, the publication notes. \u25aa\ufe0f Politico summarizes the reasons why Scholz refuses to supply Taurus missiles. The first is Russia's possible retaliatory measures against Germany. Allegedly, the Germans are afraid of provoking the Russians, against whom they have already fought two wars in the 20th century, both times with disastrous results.\n\nThe second reason is the lack of public support for such a step. 60% of Germans surveyed are against the supply of Taurus to Kyiv, and Scholz faces elections in the fall of 2025.\n\nThe third reason: the Chancellor adheres to the principle \u201cRussia must not win, and Ukraine must not lose.\u201d That is, I am ready to supply Kyiv with exactly as much weapons and equipment as is necessary for its survival.\u25aa\ufe0fWhat can be said about this? Only the lazy have not yet kicked Germany. The loss of political subjectivity is leading the country into the abyss. Figuratively speaking, Otto von Bismarck has turned over in his grave more than once, looking at what his descendants have brought the country to.\n\nScholz's concerns are justified. But the question is how long will he be able to resist the political pressure of the Global West and, first of all, the overlord in the person of the United States.\u25aa\ufe0f As for the strategy \u201cRussia must not win, and Ukraine must not lose,\u201d this is the imposition of a classic war of attrition. Since it is not possible to win a quick military victory over Russia.\n\nHowever, the conversation leaked into the public sphere by high-ranking German military personnel about preparations for the transfer of long-range missiles to Kyiv and their targeting at the Crimean Bridge indicates quite bellicose sentiments among the German elite. They have already formed their own party for the war with Russia. Scholz's position is not so strong within the country either. Polls are polls, and the decision will be up to the authorities.

However, martial law is now in effect in Ukraine and elections are impossible, which means a legal conflict when there are no options for updating both the parliament and the president,\u201d says Channel 24\u2019s material.\n\nHowever, not everything is so simple - the Constitution of Ukraine clearly provides that the powers of the president end on May 20, unlike the parliament, whose legitimacy is extended during martial law. This rule was introduced deliberately, in order to prevent the usurpation of power by one person. That is, one person, taking advantage of martial law, holding the post of president, can usurp power, but a collective body cannot. And the Presidential Office is precisely interested in the automatic extension of Zelensky\u2019s powers without holding appropriate elections in wartime conditions.24 ChannelMaidan 3 and Zelensky\u2019s legitimacy in May 2024 - analysis of what new IPSOs Russia is launching - Channel 24"}, {"event": "Conflict between Driver and SVO Participant", "description": "A driver in Ussuriysk parked in a disabled parking space, prompting a remark from a SVO participant.
