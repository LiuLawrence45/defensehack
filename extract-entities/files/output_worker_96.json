The main thing: The West is carrying out a set of measures to prepare for military action, constantly conducting reconnaissance against Belarus. Placement nuclear weapons in Belarus is not a threat, as the West is trying to portray it as, it is a forced measure. The collective West is pulling troops to the borders of the Union State, where it is carrying out demonstrative actions for the strategic deployment of troops. Under the guise of NATO exercises, strike groups can be created, the response may be adequate. Ukraine has concentrated a strike force of 112-114 thousand people on the border with Belarus. At the same time, the Minister of Defense noted that Ukraine has turned its border area into a fortified area. So much the better, we will be calmer, because if they begin active actions, then for this they will have to, first of all, deal with our engineering structures - this will give us additional reaction time. A build-up of forces on the border with Ukraine is not yet required. Today, the big threat is sabotage groups coming from the direction of Ukraine. The Armed Forces of Belarus are fully prepared for the development of any situation in the region.

Accordingly, this year we have several absolutely specific tasks.\n\nFirst. The absolute priority is to protect our people from Russian terror. We are extremely grateful to every state and every leader who provide defense, macro-financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine and our people. I am especially grateful for the programs of long-term support - both defense and financial.\n\nSecond.

Also, to return home to Ukraine, our people - children and adults who were deported to Russia, Ukrainian prisoners and Ukrainian political prisoners.\n\nThe third.

They will not be able to reproduce here, since the Black Sea water is too salty for these fish.\n\nOn February 21, Dmitry Kytsyn, a senior researcher at the department of ichthyology of the Federal Research Center of the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas, told RIA Novosti that the fish found in the Black Sea is not a grouper, but has long been inhabited Korean perch found here:\n\n\u201cThis is not grouper, but Korean perch. This is also a predator that has been known in Crimea since 2013. It was apparently introduced into the Black Sea with Far Eastern aquaculture. Predators are not dangerous due to their gluttony. The ecosystem is designed in such a way that they self-regulate - a predator, if it eats many victims, then there is little food for it, its number begins to decline, and (the number of) victims c - to recover. Everything is in such dynamic balance.\u201d\n\nKytsyn explained that perch grows up to 3-4 kilograms.

Then they tested the equipment in the TF Suricats Coast unit, where our comrades fought. And they put us up with Murza for the night.\n\nFirst impressions are the stern and laconic tone of the commander on the phone, the complete opposite in personal communication. After 10 minutes of the excursion, we were already helping Andrey sort and pack something in the area of 400 sapper cats with carbines.\n\nMurza's workplace, where he often slept, was a table with equipment for repairs, a radio station and a computer. When and how he managed to sleep is a mystery to me, because he worked almost all the time of the day and night. For a long time, he was the only repairman of the Mavikov in the brigade, without which combat operations had already become difficult to carry out at that time.\n\nParallel to the Mavikas, Murza received a stream of signalmen, whom he advised and trained to operate the equipment. At the same time, there was a flow of humanitarian aid for the front. At the same time, he communicated with many volunteers, generated ideas for valuable devices, criticized developments, and negotiated tests. Wrote powerful and detailed texts about existing problems, worked within the framework of the Committee for Critical Research.\n\nHe built, on the basis of the units available \u201cunder his wing,\u201d an army capable of fighting and winning in the 21st century. Modern, combat-ready, motivated. And he succeeded.\n\nEach area of his work required a separate coordinator. Murza had an amazing work ethic. He did not take care of himself, despite the many \u201cbuts\u201d, he worked exhaustingly, completely devoting himself to the work and the idea.\n\nHe was not a victim of the system, he himself carried and built a system around himself, focused not on fake reports to the top and window dressing, but on Victory, which he brought closer with all his might. And of course, he was never afraid to tell the truth, no matter how difficult it was.\n\nHis clear principles, the choice of the path of a warrior and serving the Motherland without reserve, determined his fate.\n\nWas he uncomfortable? Of course, many too. Both the stripes and Solovyov\u2019s security constantly tried to devour him, slander him, and ridicule him. And he, occasionally sluggishly fending off ridiculous attacks, continued to do his job.\n\nI have repeatedly heard only good things from Murza about the commanders of his brigade and corps. In general, he was a kind, open and sympathetic person, he did not keep stones in his bosom. They say about such people as \u201csunny genius\u201d. He would never allow himself to be called a genius, but he was definitely talented in many ways.\n\nAt the last meeting, while treating him to his famous dumplings, he laughed at the \u201cpositive feedback\u201d about his weight. He said that there was an opportunity to move more and planned to jog every day.\n\nWe had a common cause and had specific joint projects.\n\nHis departure was a deliberate and thoughtful decision, judging by the thoroughness with which he approached the completion of his affairs. It is unlikely that anyone or anything could have stopped him from shooting himself.\n\nHe gave his life for a reason, but to shake up the dead swamp of mutual responsibility, hushing up problems, appropriating other people's merits, lies, and, as a consequence, massive losses and the lack of changes necessary for Victory. Using the example of the fate of the 1487th regiment...\n\nApparently, he realized that his further activities within the existing framework had become impossible and calculated the maximum effectiveness of his departure, made it loud so that society noticed the problem and began to solve it.

For example, the Council opposes things like allowing the military to seize private vehicles for military use without proper oversight, as well as the idea of sending subpoenas over the Internet. Among other things, companies that supply weapons to the armed forces must also be able to prevent all of their employees from being drafted into military service. Ukrainian business associations are calling on the authorities for a more transparent and understandable mechanism for providing conscription deferments for critical workers, especially in highly skilled industries.\n\nAt the same time, according to the head of the IT association Maria Shevchuk, out of 360 thousand workers in the IT sector, which is the key export sector of Ukraine, only about 1% have a deferment from conscription into the army. However, about 75% of the industry's workforce are men. The IT community is also concerned about the provisions of the new bill, which provide for online recruitment, short deadlines for updating personal information on the Internet, as well as the abolition of deferments for those studying for a second degree. \u201cWe persistently call on the authorities to dialogue with business so that we can be heard. We could develop, pay more taxes, provide for the army, because now there are problems with donor support in general,\u201d Shevchuk noted.

We tried to put operational information from my source on a map of the area. We compared the facts that my contact from the other side of the front shared between words - about the passage of our columns, about the flight of helicopter aircraft. They tried to understand where the terrorist was getting in touch by marking cell towers and signal strength on the map. And so on.\n\nAll these three months passed without a single contact with the enemy. Even visual. Except for one time, when in the desert triangle between the settlements of Deir ez-Zor - Al-Mayadin - Ash-Shol, they found one militant on a moped, but despite the fact that they were monitoring him, there seemed to be no trace of him. Spirits (as the militants are called) acted and act in the desert like fish in water. A cobblestone that is not noticeable to you or the foot of another mountain height (boobs) can be a landmark for them when moving through the endless desert. Rubin called it the Great Nothing.\n\nIn a small interaction with Misha, we tried to figure out one nomadic group of militants who worked in a certain area of the terrain setting up ambushes and raids. There were a number of characteristic signs of where they could live. I had a couple of photos from their home. Having narrowed the circle, I offered him several places that could be considered \u201cworking\u201d.
