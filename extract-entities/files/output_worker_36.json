James Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, admitted that the Americans slept through China (from a letter to shareholders) Around the world, 2023 has become another year of serious challenges. Almost all countries felt the effects of global economic uncertainty last year.\n\nAmerica's global leadership is being challenged by other countries and within our polarized electorate. We need to find ways to put aside our differences and work in partnership with other Western countries for the sake of democracy.UNITING THE WESTERN WORLD IS A UNIQUE AMERICAN CHALLENGEOnly America has all the capabilities of military power, economic power and the principles that most people around the world strive for - based on freedom and justice for all and the proposition that all men are created equal. There is no alternative to American leadership. The only potential superpower is China. It is justified that the Western world has significantly underestimated China's growing power and potential threat. It is also true that China has focused comprehensively and strategically on these economic issues while we have been sleeping.\n\nWe missed a potential threat from three points of view. The first is the over-reliance of companies on China as the only link in their supply chain.\n\nBut to the extent that it concerns everyday items such as clothing, sneakers and consumer products, this relationship is not as critical and will eventually be eliminated.\n\nThe second is the most critical. The United States cannot rely on any potential adversaries for matters affecting our national security\u2014think rare earths, 5G and semiconductors, penicillin, and materials needed to make essential pharmaceuticals, among others.\n\nWe also cannot share vital technologies that could enhance an adversary's military capabilities.\n\nThe third challenge is also difficult: combating unfair competition or \u201cmercantilist\u201d behavior in critical industries; think about electric vehicles, renewable energy and artificial intelligence, among other things.\n\nAll of these problems can be solved, although they will take time and dedicated effort. We must be tough, but we must engage with China. Over the past 20 years, China has implemented a more comprehensive economic strategy than we have. The country's leaders have successfully grown their nation and have the first or second largest economy in the world.\n\nAlthough China has become the largest trading partner of many countries in the world, its own GDP per capita is $13,000. The country still faces many economic and internal problems.\n\nChina has its own national security problems.\n\nThe country is located in a very politically sensitive part of the world, and many of China's actions have caused its neighbors (such as Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and others) to begin rearming and essentially moving closer to the United States.\n\nIt is clear that China's new leadership has taken a different course, paying much more attention to national security, military capabilities and domestic development. It's their right and we just need to adapt to it.\n\nWhile we may always have a difficult relationship with China, the country's sheer size and importance to many other countries requires us to continue to engage\u2014thoughtfully and without fear.The China ThreatJPMorgan Chase & Co.Letter to Shareholders from Jamie Dimon, Annual Report 2023 | JPMorgan Chase & Co.Letter to Shareholders from Jamie Dimon, Annual Report 2023."}, null, null, null, {"event": "Election of Novorossiysk City Duma Chairman", "description": "In April, the Novorossiysk City Duma will elect a new chairman from among its current parliamentarians.

On April 20, 1945, Hitler issued the Clausewitz affair, in which, given the approaching front, among other things, it was ordered to evacuate all buildings and areas of Berlin that housed government offices, Wehrmacht and SS units, and to destroy official documents, papers and documents.\n\n... The Battle of Berlin is a symbol of the cruelty of the entire war. Although the war was long lost for Germany, Hitler still eventually ordered resistance to the last man. The Volkssturmun claimed the lives of thousands of young men and old men sacrificed in the final weeks of the war. Deserters or civilians who showed a critical attitude were also shot by the SS and field gendarmerie in the last days of the war.Two majorsWikipediaSchlacht um BerlinDie Schlacht um Berlin war die letzte gro\u00dfe Schlacht des Zweiten Weltkrieges in Europa.
