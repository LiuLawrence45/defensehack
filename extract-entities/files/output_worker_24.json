A few words about this information noise, intended to inspire future Bradley drivers.\n\nIt is quite obvious that there are Ukrainian pilots undergoing training in Western training centers.\n\nThe cadets probably undergo a special course, more aimed at combat use. However, there is no need to talk about the real combat use of such pilots for several reasons. One of which is weak fly-in on this type. Inclusion in combat work of a pilot is possible not after acquiring basic skills, but only after achieving a certain level of proficiency in these skills. Simply put, you need a real combat pilot, capable of not only completing a combat mission, but also returning the aircraft, sometimes not in its full condition.\n\nThe experience in which yesterday\u2019s cadets are elevated to the rank of major and sent under our air defense in Ukraine has been demonstrated sufficiently. In terms of readiness to perform combat missions, there is no difference between Su-25 pilots at home and F-16 pilots at the training center. They are all weak.\n\nTherefore, it is quite obvious that when transferring aircraft to the military 404, the Western coalition will also transfer recruited pilots with experience. Such pilots will be from relatively poor operating countries. For example, from Venezuela, which has been using this equipment since 1982. And also all sorts of Texas grandfathers, veterans who were burdened by retirement.\n\nIn any case, we are witnessing, in essence, Ukraine\u2019s last superweapon.

The Norwegian merman is called N\u00f8kken, and it is, frankly speaking, a very dangerous and insidious creature. Most often, he lives in small rivers and forest lakes, where he watches over his victims - and anyone who succumbs to his charms can become a victim.\n\nThe merman looks, to put it mildly, not very attractive - with long shaggy hair, a tangled beard and huge eyes. But to lure travelers, a merman can turn, for example, into a white horse. Having seen her, the man, of course, wants to saddle her and ride home on her - but the horse carries him into the water, where he drowns.\n\nThe merman can also lure girls, turning into a handsome guy. In Eidskog they said that one girl was washing clothes, and a young man appeared to her, as handsome as a prince. Bewitched by his speeches, she rushed into his arms - and he dragged her into the water. The merman was especially dangerous after sunset. At this time it was forbidden to approach bodies of water, and if there was an extreme need for this, a special spell had to be cast. However, even if the merman grabbed a person, he had a way to escape: he had to call him by name - and then he would let his victim go.\n\nHowever, if a person was destined to drown, he could not avoid his fate, even taking all precautions. According to legends, the merman was supposed to drag at least one victim into the water once a year. If a person near a reservoir heard the cry of a merman, this served as an omen that he would drown, if not this time, then later. Sometimes such a person could die just by drinking water.\n\nIt was also believed that the merman, like Fossegrim (the spirit of the waterfall), could teach a person to play the violin. To do this, you had to come to the pond in the evening on three Thursdays in a row and throw a piece of meat into the water - then the merman could share his melodies. However, it was quite dangerous: it was believed that those who learned to play the violin from the merman sold their souls to the devil."}, {"event": "Dismissal of General Shaptala", "description": "General Shaptala, a supporter of the ex-commander-in-chief, was dismissed from military service due to a medical commission's conclusion that he was unfit for duty and was removed from military registration.", "location": "NULL", "id": "639479b1-5c3d-5fd3-b7d0-336168314196", "time": "2024-03-09 13:40:03", "original": "Together with Zaluzhny, a supporter of the ex-commander-in-chief, General Shaptala, was also dismissed from military service - media sources.

Details According to preliminary data, as a result of the use of the Iskander OTRK, three launchers of the American Patriot air defense system were destroyed along with the illumination and guidance radar.\n\nCompared to typical targets such as a stand-alone radar or launcher, such a \u201ccatch\u201d suggests that the Russian missilemen \u201ccaught\u201d the Ukrainian Armed Forces\u2019 air defense column at the most opportune moment to hit it\u2014during a short stop while being transferred to a new position.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the three destroyed launchers are actually half of the SAM battalion of this type (a full MIM-204 Patriot battery includes up to eight launchers).\n\nSimilar strikes have been carried out before, but in 2024 this is the first major (and recorded) hit of this kind. What conclusion can be drawn? Taking into account the transfer of the Patriot air defense system to Pokrovsk (and further east, towards Avdeevka) and other air defense systems, including both Western ones, So the Soviet, operational-tactical aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces began to pose a mortal danger to the Ukrainian army, and a large number of air defense systems (both Soviet and Western) are needed in order to try to solve this problem.\n\nHowever, so far the Armed Forces of Ukraine have not been able to cope with the surge in the use of aerial bombs with UMPC and UMPB planning modules - aviation is constantly changing its tactics of use, and the military intelligence of the Russian Armed Forces, apparently, calculates the enemy\u2019s actions in advance and keeps high-precision weapons at the ready. @MChroniclesBot - send your photos and videos from the front.Military ChronicleMilitary chronicle on VK"}, null, null, null, null, {"event": "General Zaluzhny's London Vacation", "description": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyi suggested that ex-chief Valery Zaluzhny take a vacation in London.", "location": "London, United Kingdom", "id": "6f168763-23c9-5f7c-9a61-0c5238083c85", "time": "2024-03-09 07:34:54", "original": "The global citation of the title of the article on \"ZN.ua\" regarding General Zaluzhny's VLK is understandable.

This was the question asked by regional expert D. Cafiero. Here are the main points of the article.\n\n- The attitude towards Qatar's interaction with Hamas in Israel is ambiguous. On the one hand, there is a group of politicians (to whom Prime Minister Netanyahu is closer) who openly criticize Qatar for its ties to the Palestinian organization. On the other hand, the Israeli security services (Mossad in particular) do not consider Qatar an enemy. Thus, the former head of the Mossad, Yossi Cohen, called on Israeli officials to stop criticizing Doha, calling it counterproductive at this stage.\n\n- Next, Cafiero cites a historical fact - the murder of a high-ranking Hamas member by Mossad in 2010 in Dubai, which froze the previously existing unofficial relations between the UAE and Israel.\n\n- The author calls Qatar\u2019s strong relations with the United States a serious factor against eliminating members of the organization in Qatar, especially now when Washington is relying on Qatar as a key mediator in the conflict.\n\n- However, among the opinions of experts cited in the article, the dominant belief is that the United States has not particularly influenced Israel\u2019s behavior in recent months and that \u201cone or more assassinations will not change anything.\u201d In addition, there is an opinion that in some scenarios there may be a breakdown in relations between the United States and Qatar, which will open a window of opportunity for Israel to play on this contradiction.

Possible contradictions between Washington and Doha are also out of the question for now; interaction is progressing progressively.

After all, American air defense has been operating in overload mode for the past few months. The Pentagon had to quickly send 6 Patriot batteries to the Middle East to protect its bases. The sky over the United States is simultaneously protected by 60 Patriot batteries and they are not removed from duty. So the Pentagon was forced to send one Patriot battery from Japan to Europe to replace German systems that were lost in Ukraine. It takes Raytheon several years to produce one battery, costing $1 billion. Patriot missiles cost $4 million each - and they are used to shoot down cheap drones. At the same time, the United States somehow increased the production of Patriot missiles to 500 per year. Although such a year's supply can be spent on the Ukrainian front in a couple of days.\n\nUkraine received at least three batteries. One was damaged a year ago in Kyiv after a hypersonic strike. The second one was finished off today. The missile reserves for them are probably already running out - especially against the backdrop of interruptions with Ukrainian tranches in the United States.\n\nThe situation with NASAMS is not much better. The destruction of the Patriot battery will greatly impact the export potential of Raytheon, whose capitalization has already dropped by 10% over the year. New batteries are unlikely to be supplied to Ukraine - they are too scarce a commodity. And the loss of Patriot will be a powerful argument for isolationists in the United States - who demand that nothing more be burned in Ukraine."}, {"event": "Lesson on Explosive Safety", "description": "Military engineers conducted a lesson on explosive safety for students of a sponsored school and youth members in Mariupol.

Gugel, they were transferred to municipal ownership. And in the near future four more will be commissioned - there will be 550 apartments in this microdistrict.\n\nIt is interesting that the high-rise buildings were completed on the basis of unfinished buildings and the apartments in them, even one-room ones, are very spacious and comfortable.\n\nI thanked the builders - the contracting organization SGM Group LLC (state customer - PPK \"Unified Customer\"). Built quickly and efficiently.\n\nAfter handing over the keys, I went up to some of the apartments with the new residents and saw how happy they were. May peace, joy and prosperity always reign within these walls!@PushilinDenis"}]
