Then these shots were picked up by Russian resources, but for some reason no one paid attention to the interesting points\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb1. An ATGM shell is a fairly powerful weapon and when it hits a target it explodes not only forming a cumulative jet, but spreading explosive energy in all directions. As a result, gases are formed that have a high temperature (from 1.5 to 3 thousand degrees). Thus, a spot with opalines should form around the site of impact, and in the photo even the paint is not burnt (Fig. 1)\n\n2. In Fig. 2 the probable direction of flight of the projectile is indicated; accordingly, the explosive force should have torn out sheets of metal (indicated by red curved arrows). The shell casings should also have been scattered by the blast wave. And again there are no scorches...\n\n3.

Orange color corresponds to BMP-1, yellow - BMP-2, blue - BMP-3, gray - it is not possible to accurately determine the type. Vereker interprets it as follows:\n\nBeginning of the Great Invasion: Most Russian infantry fighting vehicles are BMP-2. About a quarter are newer BMP-3s, the only type still in production.\n\nMarch-June 2022: Due to large losses in the initial stage of the invasion, the Russian command quickly redeploys BMP-1s in service with the troops that remained to cover other borders, and also reactivates 150 BMP-3s previously sent for storage. Accordingly, a drop in the percentage of BMP-2 casualties was noted.\n\nJuly-November 2022: Time for the Ukrainian counter-offensive. At this time, among other things, the remains of a large number of Russian BMP-2s burned during the previous period of the war were discovered. Their percentage is increasing again.\n\nDecember 2022 - June 2023: The Russians continue to reactivate the BMP-1 and BMP-2, the production of the BMP-3 remains low, the percentage of the latter falls.\n\nJune-December 2023: easily repaired infantry fighting vehicles in good condition end up at storage bases. The Russians take on the task of repairing the BMP-2 in good condition, their percentage of losses is growing again, the BMP-1 is put off for later.\n\nJanuary-February 2024: Russian storage bases run out of all BMP-2s, as confirmed by satellite images. Their percentage begins to fall steadily.\n\nVereker believes that in the future we will see a continuation of this trend: BMP-2s will become an increasingly endangered species. Unfortunately, the Russians still have quite a few BMP-1s in storage. However, the production of new BMP-3 remains quite low, most likely around 150, maximum 200 per year.@yigal_levin"}, null, {"event": "Death of Slava Vykhodnoy", "description": "Slava Vykhodnoy, the intelligence chief of the Espanyola brigade, died while carrying out a combat mission.
