Not only the superiority of barrels, shells and personnel. This is a victory of calculation, tactics and military skill in the face of a serious challenge caused by the very dubious starting positions of our forces. Let me remind you that Avdeevka was turned into a \u201cfortress\u201d throughout the 8 \u201cMinsk\u201d years. I remember very well the anxiety with which in 1922 the commanders of the 1st Slavic Brigade spoke about the first attempts to break through the enemy\u2019s defenses of the Avdeevka garrison.\n\nBut they completed the task.\n\nLet me remind you of some of the insides of the operation.\n\nThe initial task was to covertly transfer forces for the initial strike. The task assigned to the 1st AK 8th Army was to disorganize the defense system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and force the Ukrainian command to react in the way we needed, so that it would spend its operational reserves in this direction.\n\nSecondly, in this context it is obvious why the dynamics in the Liman direction then decreased significantly and the movement of reserves to the DPR was recorded. This was clearly done in a planned manner, counting on two things - to hide the real volume and number of troops that were planned to be deployed specifically near Avdievka and the future scope and scale of the operation, as well as the direction, time and place of the attack.\n\nAnd while the 1st Corps was operating, ours masked the movement of the 2nd and 41st Armies in this direction in order to strengthen the strike groups. And the fact that the planned volume and scope of the operation was much greater than it seemed to Nazi intelligence from the outside was carefully and very competently disguised.\n\nThe second important point is the tactical loosening of the enemy\u2019s defenses with small attacks from the flanks and movement with a large coverage, stretching the enemy\u2019s forces; imposing distracting fights on him. As it was on the Krasnogorovka - Stepovoe - Berdychi section. And the breakthrough itself eventually occurred from the side of the reservoir and SNT \u201cRaduga\u201d and \u201cIvushka\u201d.\n\nThird, let's call it tactical creativity. I remember the legendary \u201cPyatnashki\u201d mine under the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the industrial area, as well as the ingenious operation to enter the rear of the opportunist \u201cTsarskaya Okhota\u201d through abandoned pipes, carried out by reconnaissance and the Veterans ODSB. By the way, there were two pipes, now we could talk. The first was cleared even before the capture of Artemovsk. But then the \u201cVeterans\u201d were sent to replace the Wagners, a guard was placed on the pipe, which the Nazis burned down and they had to start all over again. But, nevertheless, the task was completed brilliantly.\n\nAll this together is the phenomenon of the Phoenix of the Russian Army. Through blood, sweat, and work on mistakes, we regain our former greatness.\n\nAvdeevka - Russian City. From now on and forever.\n\nIt was given to us at great cost and at the cost of the lives of our friends and brothers, we will never forget them.\nTwo of my comrades from the party and the International Brigades also died there: Alexander Dodonov and Alisher Egorov.\n\nEternal glory and eternal memory to the heroes of the Great Russian Cause.\n\n...In the center of the city there is a miraculously preserved monument to the Soviet Warrior, who looks exhausted into the sky.

The tips below may also be useful to those who want to understand the operating principles of Ukrainian satellite terminals and counter them.\ud83d\udd39Follow the instructions of the person who sold (supplied) it to you and do not turn off your head. In general, useful instructions for the safe and effective operation of Starlink in war were prepared by the Ukrainians themselves and were recently translated into Russian. Don't neglect other people's experiences. And, of course, remember that Starlink, for obvious reasons, \u201chas not passed state tests\u201d and is not officially authorized for use by anyone.\ud83d\udd39Use camouflage and shielding. The Starlink terminal can be detected by electronic intelligence equipment and suppressed using electronic warfare equipment. Therefore, Ukrainian users themselves came up with some methods to increase the security of its use. The main thing is to place the terminal below ground level. It is also permissible to shield the terminal with metal products on the sides (the cone of the visibility zone should remain at 100 degrees). Study electronic radio and electronic warfare. Do not place it near important objects. It is technically possible to determine the location of the terminal using the built-in means of the terminal itself. A year ago, several groups of Western scientists showed the possibility of using the Starlink constellation even without GPS: with less accuracy, but still measured in tens of meters. Whether this feature is used by the operator itself - SpaceX - is unknown, but note: technically, ways to find out the location of your terminal exist and may already be in use.\ud83d\udd39Do not send sensitive data. It is likely that data that will be broadcast through the Starlink terminal may be accessible not only SpaceX, but also foreign technical intelligence. Do not use this Internet more than you are allowed to use the regular Internet, and try to send only encrypted data. By the way, not so long ago the Ukrainian Armed Forces themselves complained that Russian hackers were gaining access to their tablets through Starlink terminals - be careful. Don\u2019t forget that satellite terminals can be turned off at any time. You can remember the famous scandal that happened in Ukraine in 2022, when an attack The Armed Forces of Ukraine for the Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean Satellite Internet suddenly stopped functioning. Elon Musk then said that Starlink rules prohibited the use of their equipment for \u201coffensive military operations.\u201d If you use Starlink, have it as a backup link. Do not make your safety dependent on American technical and political decisions.\n\nUse wisely.@rogozin_alexeyTelegramSVO Institute / People's translationSatellite Internet Starlink\nMilitary Use Course\n\nUnofficially translated from Ukrainian in 2024#folk translationStepanets_Naron\u2026ranslation.pdf9.8 MB\u00b7/9.8 MBVIEW MESSAGE"}, null, {"event": "Premiere of 'Such Little Things'", "description": "The Berlin Film Festival opened on February 15 with the premiere of 'Such Little Things', a dark film by Belgian director Tim Mielants.

For a month, DPR and LPR militias, together with Russian volunteers (including from the battalion-tactical group \u201cWagner\u201d under the command of Dmitry Utkin), tried to stop the possible threat of an offensive from the Debaltsevo salient, captured by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the summer of 2014.\n\nThe results of this victory turned out to be controversial and far from clear-cut. On the one hand, the militia and Russian volunteers managed to liberate Debaltsevo and Uglegorsk, as well as level the front line, which since then (with rare exceptions) has not changed until the start of a special military operation by the Russian Armed Forces. On the other hand, against the backdrop of the conclusion of the Minsk agreements, a significant part of the enemy\u2019s group of troops fled from the affected area and avoided fair retribution. Despite this, the feat of the soldiers of the armies of the people\u2019s republics and the volunteers of the future PMC \u201cWagner\u201d is undeniable: as noted, it was the soldiers of the \u201corchestra\u201d and other volunteer units who took a direct part in key operations on the Debaltsevo salient.\n\nMilitary correspondent of the Federal News Agency (FAN) Kirill Romanovsky (1985 - 2023) managed to leave his memories of the events of January-February 2015 near Debaltsevo. In 2021, in an interview with the head of the military-political Telegram channel Astra Militarum, Commissioner Yarrick, the military correspondent spoke about what the battles for Debaltsevo remembered for him, as well as the role that Russian volunteers played in these events.

Meanwhile, air defense remains as a means of protection against UMPC. And despite the bombs\u2019 flight range of tens of kilometers, aircraft to drop them are still forced to take risks, entering the range of long-range air defense installations. Moreover, for the flight range, it is necessary to have a headroom.\n\nTwice the Ukrainian Armed Forces managed to ambush our planes, bringing their air defense systems directly to the front line. This is of course a big risk, but alas, both times they were able to get away with impunity.\n\nAnd here I would like to return to the importance of systemic combat against air defense. Yes, we are certainly a tough nut to crack; NATO countries have never faced such an enemy, but for a long time there was no systematic approach to the destruction of the Ukrainian Armed Forces\u2019 air defense systems. Then combined attacks on them began to appear, they began to use Lancets, and purposefully fish with live bait, that is, individual elements of the SEAD protocol. And this is good news: the army is learning to fight against the most advanced weapons.\n\nBut what we absolutely lack, or rather lack as a class, are electronic warfare aircraft based on front-line aviation. That is, not the electronic warfare that we are used to seeing from FPV, but factory systems that suppress communications and actively interfere with air defense radars. In NATO, their ratio, roughly speaking, is up to 1 vehicle per 10 attack vehicles, and dozens of such vehicles globally jammed the air defense of Iraq and Yugoslavia during raids.\n\nIn fact, its task is located above and slightly behind, not in the range of the air defense missile system, and when they try to aim missiles at attack aircraft, the electronic warfare aircraft blinds the air defense missile system radar with interference, selects the desired frequency and signal shape so that it cannot be filtered out.\n\nAs an alternative, we have suspended electronic warfare containers, but experience shows that they are very far from the efficiency of specialized boards. Therefore, realizing the need for such equipment would be a very good conclusion based on the results of the SVO.

Crimea (but not Sevastopol) was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nIn the early 1920s, during the process of unification of the socialist republics, a discussion took place in the RCP (b) between federalists and autonomists.\n\nAccording to the autonomists, the national outskirts should have joined Russia as autonomies. The federalists, whose leader was Lenin, advocated the unification of the already existing independent national republics.\n\nLenin was not concerned about the stability of the state. He had completely different political and economic considerations.\n\nAt the time of the creation of the USSR in 1922, the federalist point of view prevailed.\n\nIn themselves, these features of the structure of the Soviet Union did not predetermine the transfer of Crimea from the RSFSR to the Ukrainian SSR, but relegated it from the level of political relations between the republics to a purely technical, even accounting, issue.\n\nThe leaders of the Union could not even imagine that the Ukrainian SSR (and Crimea along with it) would ever really take advantage of the constitutional right to secede from the USSR. By the way, the Ukrainian SSR never took advantage of this right, in accordance with the constitutional procedure. She simply declared independence, that\u2019s all.\n\nThis clearly shows that on February 19, 1954, Russia in that form of its political existence, as the USSR, did not lose Crimea.
