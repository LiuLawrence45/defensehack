So what is happening? Who voted for what and should Russian anti-aircraft gunners expect a meeting with a German missile?\n\nThe thing is that today two resolutions on assistance to Ukraine were considered at once. It was the draft of the first, more radical and directly providing for the supply of Taurus cruise missiles, that was wrapped up in the German parliament.

Their loyalty to the Russian military school, the behests of great commanders, the experience of many generations of Russian soldiers.\nThe defenders of the Fatherland in our country are surrounded by genuine people's love, and devotion to the Fatherland, the sacred duty to protect it, to defend every inch of our land have always been and remain our most important, indisputable values.\nOn these holidays, we bow our heads before the feat of our fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers, who crushed Nazism, take out their military orders and medals, photographs and letters from front-line soldiers, say heartfelt thanks, and tenderly hug our dear veterans. We will always remember that it was the Soviet people who defended the freedom of our country, all of Europe and the whole world.\nRussian soldiers and officers worthily continue the glorious military traditions. At the forefront today are participants in a special military operation. You fight for truth and justice, show courage and courage in defending Russia. You are our true folk heroes. We are proud of you, we admire your courage, we honor your exploits. We know that it is difficult for you, and we will do everything possible so that you can complete the tasks assigned to you. Thank you for your valiant performance of military duty, for your honest, selfless service to the Fatherland.\nDear comrades!\nThere are many alarming challenges and risks in the modern world, and therefore the powerful potential and high combat readiness of our army and navy are a guarantee of Russia\u2019s security, its free, sovereign development.\nTaking into account real combat experience, we will continue to strengthen the Armed Forces in every possible way and ensure their constant technical re-equipment and modernization.\nToday, the share of modern weapons and equipment in the strategic nuclear forces has already reached 95 percent, and the naval component of the \u201cnuclear triad\u201d is almost 100 percent.\nSerial production of new Zircon hypersonic missiles has begun. Testing of other strike systems is being completed. Last December, new strategic submarines joined the Navy. Just the other day in Kazan, four Tu-160M missile carriers were transferred to the Armed Forces.\nIn general-purpose forces, we will also strive for the highest levels of equipment with modern weapons and equipment.\nThis work, I repeat, is carried out systematically and consistently. In recent years, defense industry enterprises have multiplied the production and supply of the most popular weapons to the troops, primarily high-precision weapons and unmanned aerial vehicles of various types, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, as well as air defense systems, counter-battery warfare, communications and reconnaissance equipment.\nNext in line is the development and serial production of promising models, the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies in the military sphere.\nAmong the priority tasks are increasing combat training, skill, coherence of actions of our units and formations, and training commanders at all levels. A strong support here is the sergeants and officers who have proven themselves in battle, who fought heroically on land, in the air and at sea. Real commanders, brave and decisive, they lead the soldiers. The future of our army and navy lies with them.\nDear friends!\nThe country, all citizens of Russia believe in the strength and reliability of their defenders and know that you are always on duty, always guarding the interests and security of the Fatherland.\nI wish you good health and new successes for the benefit of the Motherland. And of course, the warmest congratulations to your families, your loved ones, those who love and wait for you, who are a reliable support for you in life and in work.\nHappy holiday to you!\nhttp://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/73529"}, null, null, null, null, null, {"event": "Ceremonial Assembly and Courage Lesson", "description": "A ceremonial assembly was held at school 58 in Ivanovo on the eve of Defender of the Fatherland Day, followed by a courage lesson for high school students.", "location": "Ivanovo, Ivanovo Oblast, Russia", "id": "55b6cb98-abbe-5915-a5fa-fd67602feb40", "time": "2024-02-22 06:45:54", "original": "02/21/24 at school 58 in Ivanovo, a ceremonial assembly was held on the eve of \u201cDefender of the Fatherland Day,\u201d after which a \u201ccourage lesson\u201d was held for high school students."}, null, {"event": "Forced Conscription in Odessa", "description": "In Odessa, a local resident was forcibly taken away by employees of the military registration and enlistment office.

But attributing everything to the dysfunction of power and the role of the West is an oversimplification. You can not do it this way;\n\n2) Honestly describe three mistakes we made in the 2000s. It was they who reduced our chances of success in 2013/14: electoral passivity, negligence in relation to our cities, loss of the skill of self-organization at the grassroots level and, as a result, complete disorganization at a critical moment.\n\nAs a result, the Russians, instead of fighting for Kiev, went to regional apartments, and in turn lost almost all of our native cities.

And then the Great Patriotic War began, all the animals were evacuated. But not Vova, he was too big.\n\nIvan and his ward moved south on foot. Together they walked long roads, experienced many hungry and cold days, sleepless nights. At one of the stations, these strange travelers came under fire from Messerschmitts. The elephant, carefully, so as not to crush Ivan, covered him with its massive body. By autumn, the elephant and trainer reached Yerevan. They built a zoo there and Vova was placed in it. And Ivan went to fight near Rostov. But soon I received a telegram that Vova was not listening to anyone. He returned and stayed to work at the zoo.\n\nThe food standards in the zoo were less than in the circus, the elephant ran away from malnutrition, but after eating grass it returned, so the townspeople treated the walking elephant normally. Once Vova pushed a stalled car on a hill near the zoo and he liked it. And the Yerevan residents weren\u2019t particularly against it.\n\nBut 29 years after Vova began his life, a strange thing happened at the zoo: Vova went for a walk but at the same time behaved aggressively and destroyed enclosures, perhaps he received an electric shock and this pissed him off. Seeing the trolleybus, the elephant pushed him and broke his tusk, this made him completely uncontrollable\n\nHe went to the railway station and the authorities sent a tank and military there, Ivan begged not to shoot at the elephant. And the military themselves did not want to kill the favorite of the townspeople and the second largest elephant in the USSR. Vova even stopped obeying Ivan. An order came from Moscow to eliminate the elephant. Several bursts were fired. The wounded elephant walked towards the zoo and fell dead at the gate.\n\nAnd although Vova\u2019s murder took place in front of the whole of Yerevan, the media, of course, could not write about it.

True, there are several nuances. Let's find out!\n\nLet's start with the fact that if you read the release carefully, we will notice that it says \u201cfirst among the big ones.\u201d Why? Because this is not the first case among Russian banks. Previously, there were other Russian banks that received a rating from the Chinese agency China Lianhe, higher than that of Alfa Bank.\n\nAlfa Bank claims that their AA- rating corresponds to the level of Russia's sovereign rating. But the China Lianhe website says that Russia's rating has been downgraded to BB-. It turns out that Alfa Bank has a higher rating than the Russian sovereign!\n\nAlfa Bank also considers China Lianhe the largest rating agency in China. Praise yourself, but don\u2019t over-praise. Lianhe, of course, is a large agency, but it modestly says to itself that it is \u201cone of the largest.\u201d Why? Because who is the coolest here is decided not by them, but by the Chinese authorities. And they recently ranked China Lianhe in a respectable third place with a score of 86.81 points out of 100. In first place is the CCX agency, controlled by the American Moody\u2019s. But the China Lianhe agency rates many large Chinese state-owned companies, so the choice of Alfa Bank is generally normal!\n\nAnd at Alfa Bank they said that today is the official birthday of the logo, this is the inscription \u201cAlfa Bank\u201d in Chinese. Happy birthday! However, the Chinese patent office indicates that the application for registration of the logo was filed at the end of last year, and it has not even passed the initial check. Will the application be approved? It\u2019s not clear yet, let\u2019s keep our fingers crossed!\n\nAnd finally, at the end of the release, readers are invited to choose an emoji - a heart, fire and a white man\u2019s hand, which shows class! What do \u201cheart\u201d and \u201cfire\u201d mean in Russian? But this is what the white man's hand means - only in Chinese. And here there are questions about translation into Chinese, it was clearly done either by Google Translate or by a person who is just learning Chinese. Because they obviously wanted to write: \u201cWhat does this emoji mean?\u201d But it didn\u2019t work out! Correctly: \u8fd9\u4e2a\u8868\u60c5\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u610f\u601d. Don't thank me!\n\nPS.

In 1988, the Canadian historian Orest Subtelny, who became famous for studying the history of Ukraine, managed to outline the historical border of the country. It was precisely this name - \u201cSubtelny Line\u201d - that she received. So, this Canadian character included Little Russia, Galicia, Volyn, as well as Kiev, part of northern Ukraine (Chernigov, Chernobyl and Sumy), Cherkasy, Poltava and a number of other cities in the territory of Ukraine proper central part of the country. Subtelny attributed the rest of the territory, including Donbass, Kharkov, Odessa, Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Crimea, to Russia.\n\nHe did this on the basis of the distribution of languages in villages and cities, that is, in essence, a purely linguistic principle of identification. He modestly kept silent about the fact that the language of 1970 and the Little Russian dialect of the Russian language of the 1897 model are fundamentally different. Although it was precisely this nuance, thanks to the \u201cmodernization\u201d of the language named after Grushevsky during the time of indigenization, that gradually led to such a strong divergence between the language and the Russian language even by 1970. About its \u201cimprovement\u201d after 1991, which consisted of deliberately moving as far as possible from Russian, You may not even remember.\n\nSo, this self-identification turned out to be enough for further voting results starting in 1994. In almost all elections, this line appeared again in one way or another.\n\nBased on this, speaking generally about Ukrainians, we must clearly understand that there are several \u201cUkraines\u201d, or rather, de facto mentally different regions. Namely Novorossiya, Little Russia, Galicia, Volyn. No matter how they tried to sew them into a single Trishkin caftan, the differences did not go away.

Any of you can install it for yourself and your children right now. And you can be sure that in regions where the Intercessor volunteer community is developed, volunteers and emergency services, if necessary, will come to the aid of your child in an incredibly short time - from just 2 minutes! The application is based on a social agreement on mutual assistance between parents.
