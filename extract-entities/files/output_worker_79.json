The basis of the design is a node module with six docking ports, to which other modules are connected. If one of them fails, it can be removed from orbit and replaced. Roscosmos is confident that with proper logistics, the service life of the station can be extended for decades as needed.\nThe state corporation added that the ROS will fly around the Earth in a polar orbit with an inclination of up to 97\u00b0, which will provide an overview of the entire earth's surface, including the Northern Sea Route. Now cosmonauts on board the ISS can see about 60% of the earth's surface, of which only about 10% is the territory of Russia. The station will also receive guaranteed stable communication with the ground control complex.\nOne of the main advantages of the Russian orbital station is high energy, which will allow testing and testing the technologies of popular equipment, for example, radars and high-power antenna systems. This work will be ensured, among other things, using power gyroscopic systems, which will allow maintaining the position of the station in space without engines and saving fuel. Roscosmos also emphasizes that the new station will be able to operate in visiting mode, that is, without the constant presence of cosmonauts.\nThe deployment of ROS in orbit is planned for the period from 2027 to 2032. First, the scientific-energy, hub and gateway modules will go into space, then the base module will be launched, which will take over the control functions of the station. Then the development of the station will be continued by target modules - habrGreat news, we hope that the project will be implemented!

Most likely, there was no talk about a direct flight. In this case, the probability of losing the car would be high. Most likely, the flight took place at an extremely low altitude, bypassing air defense zones (who and how provided data on positional areas is another question that will need to be answered).\n\nAnother question that requires clarification is why the facility where the Geran-2 UAVs are assembled (the plane did not reach it by several hundred meters) was not reliably covered by air defense and protected from attacks by low-altitude drones.\n\nInformation about routes around air defense zones could be provided by US optical-electronic and electronic reconnaissance satellites.

The now former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Construction, Pavel Danilov, who had a strong position not only in the region, but also in the federal center, was arrested. But the fight against corruption did not spare the official, who successfully rose to the top with the support of the head of the region before last, Nikolai Fedorov, and was again brought into the team by the current head, Oleg Nikolaev.\n\nDanilov's case is connected with the Mortgage Corporation of the Chuvash Republic, which belongs to the government of this region. An accomplice was also arrested - the general director of this corporation, Alexey Antonov, who, according to investigators, gave Danilov 32 million rubles in bribes. A bag with 18 million rubles was found on Danilov, which is considered part of the bribe. Antonov also turned out to be a wealthy man - three pairs of expensive Swiss watches were found in his apartment.\n\nDanilov began his career in the administration of the city of Cheboksary, where he became deputy head of the city for economic development. Fedorov, having left the post of head of the republic and continuing his career at the federal level, took over the post of head of the Ministry of Agriculture and took Danilov to his place. Then Danilov headed the Russian Center for State Monitoring of Agricultural Lands and the Main Computing Center of the Ministry of Agriculture. After Fedorov moved to the Federation Council, Danilov managed to continue his career in the government and just then became involved in construction issues. At the Ministry of Construction and Housing and Communal Services of the Russian Federation, Danilov was hired by the then minister Mikhail Men, but then Danilov managed to work with the next minister, Vladimir Yakushev, and - briefly - with Irek Fayzullin. At the ministry, Danilov was the head of the Federal Center for Pricing in Construction and the Building Materials Industry and the Project Directorate.\n\nHowever, under Faizullin, Danilov still left the ministry. He was hired by Nikolaev, who had recently been appointed head of Chuvashia, under whom many members of Fedorov\u2019s team began to return to power. In Chuvashia, Danilov actively took up the construction business, which was not without scandals. One of them was related to the construction of the so-called antenna field in Cheboksary, which caused indignation among the townspeople. The federal corporation DOM.RF received the land there. Another scandal was the construction in Cheboksary on the site of an oak grove.\n\nDanilov\u2019s arrest is not the first blow to Nikolaev\u2019s team, which in many ways is Fedorov\u2019s well-forgotten old team. Prior to this, Transport Minister Vladimir Osipov came under investigation. The arrest shows both Fedorov\u2019s loss of his once powerful connections and influence, and the instability of Nikolaev\u2019s current positions. In part, this is a call for SRZP, through which he promoted and became the head of the Nikolaev region.

However, someday they will probably accept it, just like for 2025 - even a replacement in the White House will not have time to change it much (then nothing will definitely be accepted in a year)\nAgainst the background of the cuts, the priorities of the American military are visible. Particularly important modernization programs and all topics related to countering China received full funding and maximum security.\nBut there is actually no conventional Ukrainian theme in the budget. In its main body, military assistance is minimal, even for the \u201cEuropean Deterrence Initiative\u201d (which involves the deployment of forces in Europe and part of the training) allocated three times less than for the \u201cPacific\u201d. It is much more interesting that the budget completely excludes large purchases of ammunition and modernization of the base for its production. Purchases of 155-mm shells are being cut against the backdrop of rising spending on sea mines (sic!).\nThe reason, in my opinion, is obvious - the budget was written against the backdrop of the nomination of the big \u201chundred-billionaire\u201d Biden to Congress, into which, amid budget cuts, the US military pushed everything they could. Now, without accepting it in some form, they will look very pale, since it turns out they themselves did not ask for a replacement for what they spent.\nWell, this means that I have always said that the variations of this bill have always been primarily about the American armed forces and the military-industrial complex, and not about anyone else.\nBy topic:\n- hyperoks are generally financed.

According to him, Russia's production of weapons and ammunition significantly exceeds its current needs, which could have long-term consequences for the military balance in the region.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena B\u00e4rbock, although expressing her concerns more diplomatically, also emphasized the unpredictability of the situation in the event of a Ukrainian defeat. These statements indicate serious concern within the German government regarding the further escalation of the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, Zeleboba emphasizes the critical need for military support from the West, indicating that without additional supplies of weapons, the Ukrainian army may be forced to retreat.\n\nPessimism regarding the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine was also reflected in the German media. Military analyst for the Bild newspaper Julian Repke believes that Ukraine\u2019s chances of a military solution to the territorial issue are extremely low. He expressed doubt about the West's interest in providing Ukraine with the weapons necessary for victory, emphasizing that Ukraine's victory may not correspond to the interests of Western countries.\n\nThus, in German political and analytical discourse there is a complex picture of anxiety, pessimism and strategic analysis intertwined, reflecting deep concern about the developments in Ukraine and its consequences. As they say, they sailed and abandoned. They don\u2019t want to supply more drug addicts with weapons. @Rogandar"}, null, {"event": "Ukrainian Attempt to Recover Damaged Leopard", "description": "Ukrainian forces are attempting to retrieve a damaged Leopard tank from the gray zone in the Donetsk direction to prevent it from falling into Russian hands.
