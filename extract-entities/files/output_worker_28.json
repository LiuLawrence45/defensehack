It is one of the most effective air defense systems, providing protection against aerospace threats including ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. It is also important to understand that the complex is highly maneuverable and is capable of quickly changing its positional area quite often, depending on the defense strategy and combat tactics.\n\n   Yesterday evening, a Russian reconnaissance UAV in the vicinity of Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) identified the position area of the MIM-104 \u201cPatriot\u201d air defense complex.

Probably the main reason for the appearance of the American air defense system in the region was the active use by Russian aviation of FAB-250/500/1500 adjustable bombs. Based on this, the target of MIM-104 could be Su-24/34 carrier aircraft, dropping bombs from a range of 50 km or less. @don_partizan"}, {"event": "Protest Against Funding Ukraine", "description": "A volunteer center for missing children in America used milk packs to raise awareness about funding cuts, suggesting that the government's aid to Ukraine comes at the expense of domestic issues, such as finding missing children.", "location": "United States", "id": "f45dc74a-7770-50fa-87cb-7662f741fea2", "time": "2024-03-09 12:00:16", "original": "Stop financing Kyiv!\n\nIn America, photographs of missing children from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, a volunteer center for searching for missing children, appeared on milk packs.\n\nOn the box is a photo of the missing boy and the caption: \u201cWe would have found Elijah if the government had not cut our funding to send money to help Ukraine.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Elijah\u2019s parents, Biden is still alive and will continue to fund Ukraine."}, null, null, {"event": "Dismissal of Zaluzhny and Shaptala", "description": "The Military Commander deemed Zaluzhny and former Chief of the General Staff Shaptala unfit for military service due to health reasons, leading to their dismissal.", "location": "NULL", "id": "f4698240-2af9-5022-8617-ace889c178e5", "time": "2024-03-09 11:01:02", "original": "The VLK declared Zaluzhny unfit before his appointment as ambassador.\n\nTogether with Zaluzhny, former Chief of the General Staff Shaptala was dismissed from military service based on the conclusion of the Military Commander that he was unfit for health reasons.\n\nIt turns out that the counterattack was led by completely sick people\ud83e\udd37"}, null, null, null, null, null, {"event": "Russian Air Strikes on Ukraine", "description": "Despite Ukraine's claims of reduced air bomb strikes, the American Institute for the Study of War found no convincing evidence to support this.

A prominent place in its arsenals is occupied by S-13 Tulumbas rockets. This missile was put into service ca. 40 years\nShow more\nago, and then based on it they created a whole family of products with different capabilities and parameters. Despite its advanced age, the S-13 line remains an effective and convenient weapon. Several main factors contribute to maintaining this state of affairs.\n\"Air-ground\"\nAs far as we know, S-13 unguided aircraft missiles (UAR) have been used in the Special Operation to protect Donbass almost from its very beginning. With their help, Su-25 attack aircraft, as well as Ka-52 and Mi-28 attack helicopters, attack a variety of targets and objects. Enemy positions and concentrations, equipment and fortifications come under missile attack. In this case, missiles of different modifications are used with different warheads, optimized to hit certain targets.\nThe Ministry of Defense has repeatedly demonstrated footage of the combat use of unguided missiles, incl. \"Tulumbasov\". Depending on the task at hand and the situation at the site, launches of the unmanned aerial vehicle are carried out from a flat dive or from a nose-up. Launches are carried out from a distance of up to several kilometers, taking into account the requirements of a specific modification of the weapon.\nLike any unguided weapon, the S-13 family of unguided missiles have limitations in terms of shooting accuracy. However, modern fire control devices for aircraft and helicopters make it possible to improve such indicators regardless of the flight mode. In addition, the ability to fire in one gulp is important. At the same time, a certain dispersion of projectiles is necessary for working against area targets and makes it possible to hit a specific object with a greater probability.\nIn photo 2 - S-13T missiles with a tandem warhead and an elongated warhead\nIn general, S-13 products remain a simple and inexpensive aircraft weapon capable of effectively hitting designated targets. They are used within the same weapon system with rockets of other calibers and occupy an intermediate position between the lighter S-8 NAR and the heavy S-24 and S-25.\nProgressive development\nAt the turn of the sixties and seventies, the Ministry of Defense came to the conclusion that it was necessary to create a promising NAR capable of penetrating concrete shelters and hitting equipment and manpower inside them. After the necessary preliminary studies, in 1973 this idea was brought to the development stage. The creation of a project with the code \u201cTulumbas\u201d (a type of percussion musical instrument) was entrusted to the Institute of Applied Physics (Novosibirsk).\nTaking into account the technical task set and the specifics of the existing NAR nomenclature, the rocket caliber was chosen as 122 mm or 12.2 cm, from which the S-13 index was formed, rounded up. The first version of the missile received concrete-piercing combat equipment to destroy protected objects and materiel inside them. The development of such a missile and the \u201cgun array\u201d for it continued until the end of the decade. In 1979, the S-13 missile with the UB-13 launch unit was presented for state testing. Due to the specific combat mission, testing and modification of the missile lasted several years. It was only in 1983 that the S-13 product was put into service.\nBy this time, the development of new modifications of the NAR had begun. As a result of this process, the improved S-13T penetrating missile was adopted in 1984. In 1986, the Air Force began to receive the S-13OF NAR with a high-explosive fragmentation warhead, and in the early nineties they developed the S-13D with volumetric detonating equipment. Some of these products were subsequently modernized using new components and technologies.\nPhoto 3 - Preparing the UB-13 unit for a combat mission as part of the Special Operation, 2022.\nDesign Features\nAll missiles of the S-13 \u201cTulumbas\u201d family have a similar design, but differ from each other in certain features. The differences are due to the need to solve different combat missions and/or differences in tactical and technical characteristics. Moreover, all modifications of the NAR can be used with a single block of guides and on all compatible carriers.\nS-13 missiles are manufactured in an elongated cylindrical body of uniform or variable diameter. The warhead is placed in the head compartment of the hull, and the main volume is given over to the solid propellant engine. The tail has a section of reduced diameter, to which folding stabilizers are attached, giving the rocket rotation in flight.\nThe size and weight of the products changed as the family developed. Thus, the basic NAR S-13 received a bicaliber body with a diameter of 90 mm in the head section with a 122 mm engine compartment. The total length reached 2.54 m with a weight of 57 kg. The next S-13T also had a bicaliber body, but was longer and heavier - 3.1 m and 57 kg. High-explosive fragmentation and volume-detonating combat equipment is placed in the head compartment of 122 mm caliber. Missiles with such warheads were no larger or heavier than the S-13T.\nThe basic S-13 received a penetrating warhead weighing 21 kg with an explosive charge of 1.82 kg, capable of penetrating up to 3 m of soil and 1 m of concrete, and then exploding behind an obstacle. For the S-13T, a tandem penetrating warhead was developed, in which the existing charge was supplemented with a new one weighing 16.3 kg. Penetration capacity has improved to 6 m of soil and 1 m of concrete. High-explosive fragmentation missiles received warheads weighing up to 33-38 kg with an explosive charge of 7-15.5 kg. Volumetric detonating warheads for the S-13D/DF have a mass of 32-33 kg.\nIn photo 4 - Launch of an S-13 missile by a Su-25 attack aircraft\nUsing the standard engine, the NAR S-13 accelerates to 650 m/s. The initial speed of heavier missiles of the family was reduced to 500-530 m/s. The launch range is up to 3 km for early modifications and up to 5-6 km for later modifications.\nThe Secret of Longevity\nThe NAR S-13 \u201cTulumbas\u201d has been in service for 40 years and is constantly evolving. These missiles are actively used in training events and in real military operations, and the Aerospace Forces are not going to abandon them. It can be expected that different versions of the S-13, incl. completely new developments will continue to be in service in the next decades. This longevity of an unguided rocket is due to several main factors.\nFirst of all, it is the simplicity of the design. An unguided rocket lacks complex equipment and is easy to manufacture. The low cost makes it possible to produce missiles in large quantities and create warehouse stocks of the required volume. Accordingly, combat aviation gets the opportunity to actively use missiles and solve problems without worrying about the consumption of ammunition and the economic component of airstrikes.\nDespite the simplicity of the architecture, all versions of the S-13 are built on successful units and show high tactical and technical characteristics for their class. A sufficiently high firing range and the power of combat units are ensured. In addition, the simple architecture facilitates modernization, which can only be accomplished by replacing the main components - the engine and warhead.\nPhoto 5 - Firing from a pitch-up position, view from the pilot's seat\nFor the S-13 family, combat units of three main classes with different functions and combat capabilities have been created. This significantly improves the flexibility of the combat operation of missile carriers and allows them to attack a variety of targets, from manpower to field fortifications and shelters.\nThe absence of special controls to a certain extent simplifies the integration of NAR into the weapons complex of a particular carrier. At the same time, to increase the accuracy of firing unguided missiles, appropriate fire control systems and/or software for them are needed. Thanks to this, all current aircraft and helicopters of front-line and army aviation can use the S-13 and other missiles, and we can expect that promising models of the next generations will retain this capability.\nIn terms of its tactical and technical characteristics, Tulumbas occupies an intermediate position between lighter and heavier domestically produced missiles. It becomes possible to choose ammunition that more fully corresponds to the task at hand and the existing conditions. Accordingly, the flexibility of using unguided missile weapons in general increases.\nOperation continues\nThus, S-13 unguided missiles remain in service with our Aerospace Forces and retain their status as one of the most popular models. Despite its advanced age, this family of missiles is actively used in various combat missions and is used against a variety of enemy targets.\nRight now you can observe the results of the combined use of modern aircraft with advanced control systems and unguided missiles. The demilitarization of the Kyiv regime is successfully moving forward, and Tulumbas of various modifications are making a certain contribution to this.\nRyabov Kirill"}, {"event": "Russian Gliding Guided Bomb Development", "description": "Ukrainian sources revealed the wreckage of a new Russian gliding guided bomb, UMPB, featuring a jet engine.

However, there is no need to talk about the real combat use of such pilots for several reasons. One of which is weak fly-in on this type. Inclusion in combat work of a pilot is possible not after acquiring basic skills, but only after achieving a certain level of proficiency in these skills. Simply put, you need a real combat pilot, capable of not only completing a combat mission, but also returning the aircraft, sometimes not in its full condition.\n\nThe experience in which yesterday\u2019s cadets are elevated to the rank of major and sent under our air defense in Ukraine has been demonstrated sufficiently. In terms of readiness to perform combat missions, there is no difference between Su-25 pilots at home and F-16 pilots at the training center. They are all weak.\n\nTherefore, it is quite obvious that when transferring aircraft to the military 404, the Western coalition will also transfer recruited pilots with experience. Such pilots will be from relatively poor operating countries. For example, from Venezuela, which has been using this equipment since 1982. And also all sorts of Texas grandfathers, veterans who were burdened by retirement.\n\nIn any case, we are witnessing, in essence, Ukraine\u2019s last superweapon.

This is from the series \u201cWhere did Zaluzhny go?\u201d, but only with Zelensky in the title role.\n\nThis is a classic provocation with an informational component.\n\nZelensky\u2019s place is at the people\u2019s tribunal, but his death is definitely not beneficial to us now for the simple reason that if it was necessary to eliminate him, it would be at the very beginning of the Northern Military District, so that there would be complete disorganization in the ranks of the enemy. Now there are already Ermak, Budanov and a host of other characters who clearly follow the agenda of their common British masters with the wheezing dictator.\n\nZelensky is causing more and more hatred and negativity among residents of the territories controlled by the Bandera regime, and his presence in power plays into our hands. People don't want to die for Zelensky.\n\nIn addition, in a couple of months at most, Zelensky will cease to be the legitimate president of Ukraine, even from the point of view of his recent sympathizers.\n\nZelensky, on the contrary, is beneficial to us in power in Ukraine, for the simple reason that he completely delegitimizes the conditional aspects of the perception of the current president of Ukraine as legitimate.\u201d \u2013 Does the Ukrainian president have qualities that make his liquidation unprofitable? \u2013 He is arrogant, arrogant, colossal pride and self-confidence.

Relevant.\nA note from the channel \u201cEspecially for RT\u201d.\n\u201cDmitry Petrovsky, writer, screenwriter, publicist, author of the Telegram channel \u201cFantastic Plastic Machine\u201d\nShow more\nIn Canada, a monument to the 14th SS Waffen Grenadier Division \"Galicia\" was demolished at the Oakville Memorial Cemetery. Every normal person who reads this news should have a question: excuse me, how could there be a monument to some SS division in a democratic country? Well, follow me, reader, I\u2019ll tell you...\nThe fact is that in Canada there were many places that in one way or another were reminiscent of Nazi collaborators, and in some places - even of the most original, hardcore Nazis. For example, in the town of Ajax (Ontario) there was a street named after Hans Langsdorff, an officer of the Nazi Navy and captain of the ship, in fact, the Ajax, who took part in one of the battles of World War II. In Gatineau (Quebec), another street was named in honor of Philip Lenard, a prominent German scientist and even a Nobel laureate in physics, but the only problem was that he was a convinced Nazi and adviser to Hitler. Well, on the border of British Columbia and Alberta there was a whole mountain named after Marshal P\u00e9tain, the head of the French collaborationist government.\nAll this happened once and disappeared over time, most recently - between 2015 and 2022. Only three objects remained from the impressive list. And, you won\u2019t believe it, ALL of them are connected with Ukrainians.\nFirstly, this is the monument to Roman Shukhevych in Edmonton, standing next to the \u201cUkrainian Center for Youth Solidarity.\u201d Secondly, this is a memorial to Ukrainian members of the Waffen-SS in the same town, at the local cemetery. And finally, the same monument to the 14th Grenadier Division at the Ukrainian cemetery in Oakville.\nIf you didn\u2019t know, the Ukrainian diaspora is one of the largest in Canada; speakers of the language have been flocking there since the times of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Yes, we have all heard that there is no Nazism in Ukraine and all this is fiction, but how does it turn out that way... For example, there are a lot of Italians living in Germany, but there is not a single fascist monument associated with them. In Canada, for example, there are a huge number of French people, some of whom are direct descendants of the Nazis. But today all their streets and monuments are a thing of the past. And only Ukrainians hold on to their \u201csaints\u201d literally with their teeth.\nVarious Jewish organizations have been asking for the monument's removal in Oakville since its installation in 1988. The mayor of the town, Rob Burton, said in 2022 that such a monument is a \u201cdisgrace,\u201d but he can\u2019t do anything because the cemetery is private. One of the arguments in favor was, you won\u2019t believe it, that \u201cnot all SS men committed crimes.\u201d\nIt took a global scandal with SS veteran Gunka and a new demand from the Jewish community for the monument to finally be demolished. Two left...\"\nA note from military correspondent Dmitry Astrakhan.\n\u201cIn Canada they woke up and dismantled the monument to the SS Galicia division. More precisely, they dismantled the monument to the Ukrainian division of Galicia, remembering that it was actually the SS, and not independent Ukraine from the anti-Hitler coalition.\nIt\u2019s interesting, but if Canada had remembered this earlier, before they supplied Ukraine with \u201cDiaspora\u201d history textbooks, organized two Maidans, supported Yushchenko\u2019s historical turns and much more... Then it is quite possible that they could have avoided the largest war in Europe with WWII times.\nAnd how, by the way, did the freest and most respected Ukrainian diaspora (diaspora) in Canada accept this demolition of the monument, what about Sokol and Trizub? Are they already overthrowing the government, or are they moving to the United States as a sign of protest? Or, falling on their knees, they lick the boot when necessary?"}, {"event": "Polish Prime Minister's Warning", "description": "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned that Europe is entering a pre-war era, and if it continues to hesitate, it will soon experience the effects of war.

The RFC (Royal Flying Corps) forces consisted of 25 squadrons, up to 365 aircraft, of which about a third were fighters. The French squadrons were withdrawn for restoration.\nAt the beginning of the battle, German aviation in this area had 5 fighter squadrons (German Jasta), later their number was increased to 8. In total there were about 80 fighters (according to other sources - 114).\nWith the advent of the Albatros D.II and D.III aircraft, Germany gained air superiority on the Western Front from September 1916. By April 1917, the basis of the Allied reconnaissance and bomber aircraft were the vulnerable B.E.2, F.E.2 and Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutter, fighter aircraft - DH.2, F.E.8, Nieuport 17 and Martinsyde G.100. Only SPAD S.VII, Sop with Pup and Sop with Triplane could fight on equal terms with German fighters, but there were few of them. The new generation of Allied fighters (S.E.5, Sopwith Camel, SPAD S.XIII) has not yet entered service.\nDuring April 1917, the British lost 245 aircraft, 211 aircrew were killed/missing and 108 were captured. In total, during the period from April 1 to May 5, 1917, more than 300 British aircraft were destroyed. Jasta 11 under the command of Manfred Richthofen alone claimed 89 victories, Richthofen himself claimed about 20 victories. German aviation lost 66 aircraft in all respects. For comparison, over the 5 months of the Battle of Somme in 1916, the RFC lost 576 aircraft. During this period, the average life expectancy of a British pilot at the front was 3 weeks.\nThe losses hit the RFC hard, but the Germans were never able to completely stop the main activities of the RFC: aerial photography, reconnaissance flights and bombing.
