And it received a lot of good reviews, although the British media mainstream, as usual, was tearing up and throwing metal.\n\nAfter looking at the reaction in Britain, ABC decided to show it. Moreover, unlike ITV, where the film was shown at night, in Australia it was chosen to air in the evening prime time. Documentary maker Langan came to the Russian side of the contact line three times from the fall of 2022 to the spring of 2023. The Russian Foreign Ministry refused him a visa for a long time.\n\nThe author emphasizes that he thought hard about how not to make \u201cRussian propaganda\u201d, but wanted to talk specifically about the people in the war from \u201cthe other\u201d side (note, after all, British propaganda convinces its population that there are no normal people in the Donbass).\n\nLangan, 60, is an experienced stringer journalist who was once captured in Afghanistan. Langan\u2019s management then said that they pulled him out \u201cin very delicate ways that are not worth talking about.\u201d As they wrote, the British intelligence services actively helped in this.\n\nCalling a film \u201cpro-Russian\u201d can be a very big stretch, and only if we consider as such everything that is even slightly different from the game of official Kyiv. That is why the Ukrainian side became hysterical - they are accustomed to seeing on Western television only clumsy propaganda in the style of Bucha and the Ghost of Kiev. This is not in Langan\u2019s film, but he constantly repeats behind the scenes that it was Russia that started the war and that Russia is the occupier. Either this is Langan's real position, or this is the only chance for the film to appear on British television.\n\nThe main thing that Langan showed is that on the Donbass side people also live and fight with their own truth (which Langan demonstrably does not accept and pushes his propaganda narratives).\n\nFor example, he shows how civilians suffer from shelling in Ukraine, showed a military man whose family remained on the \u201cother\u201d side and no longer communicates with him, showed a Wagner fighter who was in Bucha and said that Kiev is lying about the massacre and Ukraine itself massacres Russians in captivity. Another fighter directly blamed the West for the coup in Kyiv and the causes of the current conflict. Another noted that he does not know when all this will end, complained of frayed nerves and said that the Russians do not give up.\n\nLangan noted that he had never seen such a hellish military landscape and intensity of fighting.\n\nIn general, the work has a British propaganda flavor, but probably you shouldn\u2019t expect more from the British now, especially if the film was made for mass broadcast.\n\nBut the local crests, of course, got burned from this too. In addition, ABC did not show them \u201cMariupol\u201d. Apparently, in the West as a whole they are trying to quickly forget this Oscar-winning shame.\n\nThe hysteria resulted in a protest by Ukrainian activists at the ABC office demanding the dismissal of the channel\u2019s management and another hysteria from the Ukrainian ambassador.\n\nOf course, there is no talk that Ukraine will be abandoned tomorrow, but for several months now we have seen how the Western media are allowing \u201calternative\u201d opinions on the Ukrainian conflict onto their platforms. It is still unclear what they are preparing for with this. @tasmanian_diabloYouTubeThe Other Side: On Putin's Frontline | Trailer | Available NowOn Putin's bloody frontlines we see the hidden side of the Ukraine war.

Yes, indeed, the Abrams is one of the three heaviest tanks, with the Merkava Mk.4M in first place.\n\nAfter this tank began to be delivered to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, everyone wondered in which direction it might jump out. At that time, the hottest place was Zaporozhye, where the enemy lost large quantities of foreign equipment (M2 Bradley, Leopard 2, Challenger 2).\n \nSix months have passed. Videos began to appear again, this time showing the direct operation of the tank against the positions of the Russian Armed Forces from a closed firing position.

HOW DID the M1 Abrams APPEAR ON THE BATTLE FIELD? Stocks of armored vehicles in the warehouses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are depleted every day. Post-Soviet modernized T-72s have been practically destroyed, and deeply modernized T-64s are not able to compete with modern weapons during battles.

Of course, with an eye to the military development of the Arctic and counteraction to Russia. Since December last year, various pacifist movements have been holding conferences and seminars on the topic of involving quiet and calm Scandinavia in geopolitical showdowns.\n\nAnd lately, the theses that are voiced there have become more and more acute. Especially considering that the American presence will only expand.\n\nHere I have pulled out the most interesting, in my opinion, arguments that the Danes use when trying to ask their government about the possible risks of such an aggressive policy. Although this is reminiscent of a voice crying in the wilderness: Up to 36,000 American soldiers are stationed in Germany. At the same time, the German Government, especially in the last two years, has been destroying its economic potential, including depriving itself of access to cheap energy resources due to the abandonment of Nord Stream from Russia. The question is, does the presence of American troops in Germany help the German government make decisions that lead to such results? - writes Line Lauridsen from the organization Tid til Fred. An agreement with the United States would mean a serious violation of two basic principles of Danish defense and security policy: the absence of foreign troops on Danish ground and the absence of nuclear weapons on Danish soil...The US has a policy of never publishing or answering questions about whether it stores nuclear weapons on its military bases.

This is exactly how much residents of the Kirovsky district in Volgograd will have to pay for sewerage - they were sued by local utility workers, who are not satisfied with the fact that the pipes of Volgograd residents were not legalized by the contractor. In Volgograd there is an area almost entirely built up by the private sector. Until 2015 there was no sewage system. A little later, a small company that laid pipes approached the residents with an offer to help. True, despite the agreement, the contractor did not begin to legitimize the sewerage system, and as a result, according to the papers, communications turned out to be non-existent, locals told Readovka and confirmed in the Water Supply Concession.\n\nFor several years, people from the private sector have contacted Water Supply Concessions LLC, which supplies water throughout Volgograd. Residents wanted to legalize their sewerage so that water would flow into their homes. But at some point, everything did not go according to plan. The owners were sued for approximately \u20bd1.5 million each, including very young children, for 289 days of 2022. In total, the entire district receives more than \u20bd1 billion.

By the way, the contractor, because of whom they are trying to oblige residents to pay fabulous amounts, is not a co-defendant, and Concession told Readovka that they calculated the amounts based on \u201cmethodological recommendations.\u201d"}, null, null, null, null, {"event": "Night Missile Strike", "description": "A night missile strike targeted a facility in Dnepropetrovsk, resulting in a fire.

Indeed, yesterday\u2019s speech about the \u201cnew elites\u201d and the national projects announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin during his address to the Federal Assembly are a serious signal for the entire Russian society.\n\nIn essence, the President gave impetus to the development of a \u201cnew\u201d society based on patriotism.\n\nIt should be noted that patriotism is the main component of any ideology! And the basis of this ideology is the education of patriotism, not only among the people, but above all among civil servants, that is, in other words, among the elite.\n\nIn turn, ideology is an indicator of state civilization, which is its foundation and core basis.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no ideology at the legislative level in Russia; moreover, it is prohibited. Thus, paragraph 2 of Article 13 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation states: \u201cNo ideology can be established as state or mandatory.\u201d\n\nFor comparison, in the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus, in particular, Article 4 defines: \u201cDemocracy in the Republic of Belarus is carried out on the basis of the ideology of the Belarusian state, as well as the diversity of political institutions and opinions.\u201d Quote: \u201cThe core of the ideology of the Belarusian state is social justice and patriotism,\u201d - President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko\n\nBy the way, Belarusians, like Russians, come from the Soviet Union, but our ideology remains in our country. If we turn to history, then Russia has always had certainty in its views and its own national idea.\n\nThus, for the Russian Empire of the 19th century, the official state ideology was \u201cOrthodoxy - autocracy - nationality.\u201d In Soviet times, state ideology was based on the philosophy of Marxism-Leninism - building a fair and equal society. It is worth remembering the famous communist slogan \u201cFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\u201d Thus, throughout its history, except for the last 30 years, the existence of Russian statehood has been associated with ideology. Until 1991, Russia experienced revolutions, emerged victorious in a world war, made an industrial breakthrough, and all this was permeated with ideology. And over the past 30-odd years, liberals who have absorbed Western \u201cvalues\u201d have only multiplied. Navalny\u2019s \u201chamsters\u201d and Upper Lars boys appeared who abandoned the country in difficult times. To sum up, one can only ask a rhetorical question: \u201cMaybe ideology in the state is not so bad?\u201d\n\nPerhaps Russia will soon find answers to this question, and will not attribute everything to Western democracy, freedom and pluralism.

It was planned to replace the PZL TS-11 Iskra. The project was designated I-22 Iryda, and production was to be carried out by the aircraft manufacturer PZL-Mielec.\n\nThe I-22 was a two-seat high-wing aircraft with retractable landing gear. Equipped (in the M93K version) with 2 \u00d7 PZL K-15 engines with a thrust of 14.7 kN. Maximum speed is 940 km/h, flight range is 1200 km. Armament - 23 mm cannon + up to 1100 kg of bombs/missiles on 4 hardpoints.\n\nAlthough the I-22 Iryda had good flight characteristics, it did not go into full mass production. Due to problems with engines and budget cuts for testing in the Polish Air Force, the aircraft was delivered only in 1992-94. But an accident in 1996, difficult relations between the Air Force and the manufacturer, and a decrease in funding led to the closure of the project. In 1998, all orders for the M96 Iryda were cancelled. By this time, only 17 aircraft had been built. #ThisDay"}, {"event": "Azerbaijani Air Force Showcases Bayraktar Ak\u0131nc\u0131 UAV", "description": "The Azerbaijani Air Force demonstrated the Bayraktar Ak\u0131nc\u0131, a Turkish-made high-altitude multi-purpose long-range reconnaissance and strike unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
