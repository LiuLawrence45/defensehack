The US cannot finance such a war, and our current military cannot lead us to victory.

While the Justice and Development Party (ak parti/AKP) attracts about 30 million votes and has 12 million members, some voters are expressing dissatisfaction and are considering voting for Yeniden Refah Partisi in protest. The vote shift is not likely to have a significant impact on the ruling party's national results, but could affect results in some key cities, including Istanbul, where the backlash could benefit the Republican People's Party (CHP). Despite this, the majority of voters still support the AKP, valuing its achievements in infrastructure, the defense industry, the fight against terrorism and an active foreign policy. Still, some conservative and religiously minded voters are feeling disillusioned.
