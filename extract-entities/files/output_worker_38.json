New realities, extremely maneuverable warfare and rapid changes of positions, attack UAVs make such vehicles mandatory. And the same mortar crew has much less chance of getting surprises, having a banal loaf of bread on hand for transporting the crew, guns, shells and quickly changing positions (and a captured 60-mm can fire directly from the vehicle, with proper skill ).\n\nUnfortunately, in the absence of special vehicles, we have to use civilian UAZs, Nivas, and just passenger cars. But they are far from being as durable as those intended for military life, and many drop out simply by getting stuck off-road or due to breakdowns that cannot be repaired promptly on the side of the road. And the same drones won\u2019t let you stand on the side of the road and fix things for a couple of hours. In addition, combat damage has not been canceled either, and vehicles deprived of any armor suffer doubly from them.\n\nBut the most important thing is that such vehicles are delivered to the front by volunteers and face a lot of problems. After all, having bought a car, you need to somehow transfer it to the unit and transportation is the least of the problems here. Very few parts are ready to officially register the car, so volunteers just have to deregister it and then say that the car is lost somewhere. And this is probably the main problem that volunteers face when transferring transport, the inability to formalize it, especially various funds and NGOs suffer from this, simply not being able to \u201close\u201d transport from their balance sheet.\n\nWe will wait for changes in legislation for NGOs, targeted transfers and targeted grants to help the front will solve a lot of problems at the front and in the rear.\n\nAnd professional photo"}, null, null, null, {"event": "Russian Ambassador Summoned", "description": "The Russian Ambassador was summoned to the Moldavian Foreign Ministry to address concerns over the opening of polling stations for the Russian presidential elections in Transnistria.

Chewing gum as a symbol of an unattainable dream By March 10, Barrie Coop held several matches. News about a \u201cproduct from the capitalist world\u201d that is being given away for free has spread throughout Moscow.\nIn the Sokolniki Palace there were 4 thousand people eager not so much to watch the game as to get that coveted chewing gum.\n\nAfter the match, the crowd rushed to the exit closest to the Canadian bus. But to prevent people from disgracing themselves by begging foreigners for chewing gum, the police closed the exit.\n\nSomeone in the crowd tripped, someone fell and a mad stampede began. The back rows, not seeing what was ahead, pressed forward. As a result, 21 people died and another 25 were injured. Many of the victims were under 16 years old. Authorities' reaction The Soviet press did not say a word about the stampede. It was possible to find out about what happened only from a message broadcast on the Voice of America radio station.\n\nThe workers of the sports palace and the police officers who \u201cprovided security\u201d were declared guilty. Four people were tried and given three years each, but then given amnesty.\n\nIn a country of total shortage and \u201cthe most delicious ice cream,\u201d people were ready to trample others for the sake of chewing gum. By the way, a year later factories for its production opened in the USSR. Apparently, they were afraid of history repeating itself at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow.#interestingSubscribe /Eng Twitter/YouTube /Eng Telegram"}, null, {"event": "Delivery of New Submarines", "description": "The Russian Navy will receive four new submarines in 2024: two nuclear submarines, Prince Pozharsky and Arkhangelsk, and two diesel submarines, Yakutsk and the second serial Lada.
