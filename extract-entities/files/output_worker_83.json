Of course, the drone did not fly 1200 km from the border with Ukraine. Soviet UAVs of the Tu-141 Strizh type, which the crests had at the beginning of the war, have a shorter range, up to 1000 km. Even if it was a Western analogue, launching it from a border area that is clearly visible and full of air defense is an extremely risky undertaking and doomed to failure.\n\n2. The launch was clearly from Tatarstan itself, or from neighboring regions. Does the existence of enemy agents inside our country raise a question for anyone? Possibility to build a drone? Opportunity to buy explosives on the darknet?\n\n3. Close control over migration is necessary. And not only for the Eastern Turkestan, but also for the Western. Nationality does not play any role here. Russian-Ukrainian, Tajik-drug dealer from Afghanistan - it doesn\u2019t matter. At least they can hire Japanese for this kind of work.\n\n4.

However, how was, for example, raising your voice assessed by Western social services? It must be understood that it was not marginal families, in which it is customary to shout at each other and fight, that were able to leave for Europe; it was mainly those who had the means, who belonged primarily to the middle class, who managed this trip financially. But there they found themselves in a situation where they could not protect their own children from removal and transfer to services that did not serve their interests or the interests of Ukrainian children.\n\nIn general, an extremely unfavorable picture emerges with regard to the attitude towards children of Ukraine and its owners, namely dark stories with pupils of social institutions, illegal removal of children from families by Ukrainian kidnappers such as the White Angel gang under the guise of evacuation, criminal sales to organs.

If any of them exhausts its resource, it can be removed from orbit and replaced. With proper logistics, the service life of the station can be extended for decades, as needed.\n\nAnother important point is the polar orbit in which the station will fly around the Earth. The ISS has an orbital inclination of less than 52 degrees, while the new station is planned to have an orbital inclination of up to 97 degrees. This will give an overview of the entire earth's surface, including the Northern Sea Route, which is strategically important for our country. Now cosmonauts on board the ISS can see about 60% of the earth's surface, of which only about 10% is the territory of Russia. The station will also receive guaranteed stable communication with the ground control complex.\n\nOne of the main advantages of ROS is high energy, which will allow testing and testing technologies of equipment that is in demand in our astronautics, for example, radars and high-power antenna systems.\n\nUnlike the ISS, the new station will be able to operate in visiting mode (without the constant presence of astronauts).\n\nThe deployment of the ROS is planned for the period from 2027 to 2032.
