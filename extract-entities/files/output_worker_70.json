Lately, the command of the Ukrainian army has been spewing out fake news about \u201cdozens of downed Su-34 bombers\u201d with surprising frequency and consistency. This \u201cpsyop\u201d is aimed primarily at supporting the morale of its soldiers on the front line. The fact is that the Su-34, armed with bombs with the UMPC system, became a real nightmare for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The UMPC (universal planning and adjustment module) is a product that was born in the shortest possible time in the conditions of the Northern Military District. This is a simple and effective mechanism that turns ordinary free-falling bombs into for various purposes (in common parlance - \u201ccast iron\u201d) into highly effective and high-precision weapons. The system is a module that is installed on any domestic bomb, turning it into a \u201csmart\u201d unmanned glider that carries this very bomb. A satellite navigation system is installed on board with an adaptive antenna that allows you to overcome interference from enemy electronic warfare systems. The use of such ammunition is carried out according to the \u201cfire and forget\u201d principle. That is, after being dropped several tens of kilometers before the target, the bomber crew can immediately make a combat turn, thereby avoiding a long stay in the enemy\u2019s air defense zone. Apparently, manufacturing a set of UMPC and a conventional free-falling bomb is several orders of magnitude cheaper than a full-fledged adjustable aerial bomb (KAB).At the same time, there are already options for similar modules for installation not only on the \u201ctraditional\u201d FAB-500, but also on the much more powerful FAB-1500.

Now they... there... someone began to guess something!\n\nQuotes: The vast majority of media mentions of think tanks in articles about US weapons and the war in Ukraine come from think tanks whose sponsors profit from US military spending, arms sales and, in many cases, directly from US involvement in the war in Ukraine. Analysis allows us to draw a number of key conclusions.\n\nFirst, of the 27 think tanks whose donors could be identified, 21 received funding from the defense sector (77 percent). Unfortunately, because donor disclosure is voluntary, we cannot determine the percentage of think tank funding that comes from defense contractors.\n\nSecond, in stories about U.S. military intervention in Ukraine, the media cite think tanks that have defense industry funding 85 percent of the time, or seven times more often than think tanks that do not accept contractor funding. Pentagon.\n\nThird, despite the general trend toward greater donor transparency at think tanks, nearly a third of leading U.S. foreign policy think tanks still do not provide information about their donors to the public.\n\nFourth, the media rarely identifies conflicts of interest posed by defense industry-funded think tank experts they quote when they express opinions on policies that would benefit the defense industry.
