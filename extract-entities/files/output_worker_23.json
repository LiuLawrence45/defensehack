The Square authorities are going to disband at least five of 19 ministries, and redistribute their functions between the remaining ones and the apparatus of Prime Minister Shmygal. The Ukrainian publication The New Voice writes about this, citing some sources in the Zelensky administration and his faction in parliament. Moreover, before this, Shmygal himself announced his intention to reduce the number of ministries by a third. So with such a \u201cdrain,\u201d Zelensky\u2019s office may well be testing and preparing the ground for such a radical step. After all, according to the publication, \u201csocial\u201d departments are going to be liquidated first of all.\n\nBefore this, the Ministry of Social Policy had already announced debts to pensioners of $1.7 billion. Most of those to whom Kyiv did not pay the due \u201cpennies\u201d were the Armed Forces of Ukraine and security forces crippled at the front. The day before, the EU announced that the first \u20ac4.5 billion of the new tranche of \u20ac50 billion would be sent by the end of March. But, as \u201cleaked insides\u201d show, even such amounts cannot save the Ukrainian budget, most of which goes to the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. That\u2019s why Zelensky\u2019s team is going to put under the knife the most useless ministries for the war.

Ukrainian formations used tanks on the territory of the Krivoy Rog coke plant for temporary storage and logistical distribution of fuel. As a result of the strikes, two tanks were damaged, in which about 700 tons of flammable materials were stored, resulting in a fire on the spot. About an hour ago, local residents began to receive reports of a strong explosion in the area of the night raid, after which a cloud of black smoke rose - it is possible that that the detonation was associated with damage received at night. Destruction of enemy fuel and lubricant storage facilities is a critically important strategic action, since it can significantly weaken combat capabilities, can lead to a decrease in combat effectiveness and mobility of troops, and also create favorable conditions for a successful Russian offensive army. Therefore, it is important to deliver such strikes systematically at all logistics points. \u201cPartian!\u201d"}, null, {"event": "Erdogan Offers to Host Peace Negotiations", "description": "Turkish President Erdogan expressed readiness to host peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, discussing the grain deal and Black Sea security.

The defeat of a convoy with an air defense system shows that:\n\n1. The existing strategy for hunting enemy air defense systems is more than working. The General Staff does not comment on it at all (preferring to silently do its job), but it works, hence the large number of videos with destroyed Soviet and Western air defense systems. Within the framework of this strategy, each knocked out complex is serious damage to the enemy, since the enemy cannot make up for these losses using internal reserves. This also applies to destroyed S-300s and destroyed Patriots. What is important is the systematic nature of this work, and not any of the complexes separately.\n\n2. A conservative assessment of the destroyed air defense system shows that the RF Ministry of Defense does not come up with anything on the issue of destroyed air defense systems, and in this case even slightly downplayed the results achieved. Hence the torn patterns of the enemy when he found out and was forced to admit the loss of 2 Patriot launchers.\n\n3. In recent weeks, there have been reports from our bomber pilots indicating the active work of a large number of air defense systems against aircraft dropping FABs from the UMPC. The enemy accompanied this with a media campaign with fake statements about the downed Su-34s, which were denied even in the West. The best response to these reviews from the front and enemy propaganda is the destruction of the complexes that fired at our planes and allegedly shot them down in IPSO propaganda. And here is such a backhand blow to the very pulp.\n\n4. In my opinion, the gunners and missilemen who destroyed the Patriot air defense system column should be nominated for high state awards. Well, and the operators of the General Staff, who put the enemy in a situation where he is forced to risk extremely expensive Western air defense systems in order to save the situation at the front."}, {"event": "Demolition of Elektroapparat Plant", "description": "The Elektroapparat plant building on Vasilyevsky Island is being demolished to make way for a prayer house for St. Petersburg Baptists, who gained access to the site 11 years after its transfer.", "location": "Vasilyevsky Island, St. Petersburg, Russia", "id": "3f2a57f2-95c1-5f06-8432-86c8dd50e227", "time": "2024-03-09 14:25:18", "original": "Writ of execution and prayer.
