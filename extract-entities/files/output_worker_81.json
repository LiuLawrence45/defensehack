Yusuf Kabardikov, the head of Stroy-Garant LLC and a number of other construction companies, collected more than 130 million rubles from shareholders, but did not fulfill his obligations, did not build apartments, and did not return the money to shareholders. A criminal case has been opened against him on charges of fraud and illegally raising funds from citizens. He was taken into custody and spent some time in a pre-trial detention center. Later, his preventive measure was changed and he was released from custody.\n\nBankruptcy will save the developer from debt obligations, even if the proceeds from the sale of property are not enough to fully repay them. Through bankruptcy it will be possible to get rid of debts to banks, tax arrears, etc.\n\nIt is still unclear what will happen to the shareholders, how the issue of providing them with housing or returning their money will be resolved.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the fact that many of them entered into legally incorrect agreements with Kabardikov. That is, these were not equity participation agreements, as required by law, but agreements of intent for the purchase and sale of apartments that had not passed state registration. True, some shareholders later achieved registration of agreements through the court, but not all of them.

There are no reliable agents in this environment. Everything is bought and sold there, so we get to the customers.\n\n\u2014 Criminal syndicates operating in Russia often turn out to be cross-border, collaborating with foreign intelligence services.\n\n\u2014 Last year the number of crimes decreased.\n\n\u2014 More than 3.2 million residents of Donbass and Novorossiya received Russian passports.\n\n\u2014 We need to continue working on issuing Russian passports in new regions and approach people with soul.\n\n\u2014 When issuing passports in the Donbass, the Ministry of Internal Affairs must prevent the legalization of saboteurs and neo-Nazi collaborators.\n\n\u2014 We need to radically update approaches to migration policy; some of our compatriots cannot obtain citizenship for years.\n\n\u2014 Existing electronic databases are not enough to mitigate the risks of illegal migration.\n\n\u2014 Only those who respect its traditions, language and culture should be able to come and live in Russia.\n\n\u2014 The number of crimes using IT has increased by 30% in the Russian Federation, we need to seriously improve the mechanisms to combat them.
