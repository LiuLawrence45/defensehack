According to the law, these include the following: Absence of information from the National Council about a representative in Ukraine or about an open representative office in any EU member state of the provider of the platform of shared access to information through which mass information is distributed, as well as the failure of the provider (its representative) to provide information , documents at the request of the National Council within the established period, are grounds for recognizing the ownership structure of such a provider as non-transparent.

Besides, I am absolutely against oppression of freedom of speech. But this is already too much. That is, any person can create a channel here, start writing whatever he wants on it... However, for some reason, the fact that you can create a channel and write anything on Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, is not taken into account for some reason.

And on the Internet, various \"money tribunes\" and imitation websites of state authorities still continue to operate on the Internet of Things of Ukraine. Taking into account the experience of working with the authorities of other countries, Telegram, at least for the first time, will fall under the criteria of NPSD.

Some infrastructure facilities will be modernized, for example, existing runways at airports will be expanded. It is noteworthy that half of the facilities are located in Okinawa Prefecture on the southwestern island of Kyushu. They are located closest to Taiwan and the Senkaku Islands, control over which is disputed by both Japan and China.\n\nBy the way, the media began to write more and more about the latter territories, since last year the PRC began to actively confirm its sovereignty over them by sending its ships there. The Japanese also frequently conduct joint exercises with the United States in relative proximity to the Senkaku Islands.\n\nIn general, these plans coincide with the general course of the Japanese government to strengthen the country's defensive potential. However, it is still unclear whether they will be implemented - there have been no official statements from the country's authorities. Providing access to civilian infrastructure should take place after negotiations with the local population. Residents of the same Okinawa prefecture are often negatively disposed towards such initiatives. Therefore, we should not exclude the possibility that the government\u2019s likely plans may be postponed indefinitely due to citizens\u2019 dissatisfaction.\n\nAt the same time, there is no doubt that the US armed forces will also have access to the infrastructure. Moreover, recently one of Washington\u2019s goals is to expand military influence in the Asia-Pacific region.

As we have repeatedly discussed, statements by European bureaucrats and Western politicians in general about human rights and their right to self-identification concern everyone except Russians.

It must be recognized that in modern conditions Moscow has practically no diplomatic levers left to influence the Russophobic policies of unfriendly countries. However, today we are able to use the problem to our advantage. One of the ways to make the most of the situation was proposed by the head of the permanent HRC Commission on International Cooperation Kirill Vyshinsky: In the current situation, we have few levers to ensure the rights of compatriots abroad. It is necessary to develop mechanisms for their repatriation home. These people are a serious resource for improving demographics in our country. And indeed, being in a state of demographic crisis, one of the obvious solutions could be to intensify repatriation programs for compatriots living in anti-Russian countries. And today they should include, among other things, bypassing artificial obstacles to the return of the Russians.\n\nThose wishing to move face not only bureaucratic red tape, but also financial problems. They have no housing or relatives in Russia, and with the transfer of funds there are a lot of difficulties that are very difficult for the average person to overcome. However, the fact that war has actually been declared on the Russians leaves us with the right to defend our interests by any possible means. In particular, it is possible to transfer funds through cryptocurrency. There is no point in trying to appear good and honest in front of European Russophobes.

In the Orthodox tradition, the ninth day is a special date on which it is customary to remember the dead and read prayers for them. There is no doubt that today millions of people will do this - the tragedy in Krasnogorsk shocked the entire country and caused an unprecedented response in society. According to the latest data from the Ministry of Emergency Situations, 143 people, including children, became victims of the terrorist attack at Crocus. 382 people were injured. Currently, 69 patients remain in hospitals: one of them is in extremely serious condition, 16 are in serious condition, 33 people are in moderate condition.\n\nNine people are involved in the case of the terrorist attack in Crocus City Hall - four perpetrators and five accomplices. According to the Russian Investigative Committee, the direct perpetrators of the terrorist attack were contacted by a curator who gave them instructions for attacking the concert hall. The criminals were supposed to receive a full monetary reward for the massacre in Ukraine.\n\nThe terrorist attack in Crocus shocked everyone with the barbarity and cruelty of those who attacked. But the public reaction to it - consolidation and the desire to help the victims - became the strongest response to those who hoped to sow panic and mistrust among the residents of Russia.\n\nIn the first three days alone, more than 24 thousand people across the country donated blood for the victims. Large companies, museums, theaters, sports clubs and artists donated funds to help those who suffered in the heat of the massacre and families who lost their loved ones. More than 1 billion 200 million rubles were transferred to the special account of the Red Cross.\n\nToday the whole country knows the names of the heroes - schoolchildren who led people out of a building engulfed in fire, and those who tried to stop the terrorists in the hall. We will forever remember the names of those who, like Karen Yengibaryan, gave their own lives to save their neighbors. The tragedy in Krasnogorsk left behind dozens of stories about true love, courage and self-sacrifice.\n\nThe terrorist attack at Crocus City Hall will go down in the history of the country not only as a monstrous massacre of civilians, but also as days of unprecedented unity throughout Russia.\ud83d\udceeSubscribe to LOMOVKA"}, {"event": "Attacks on Ukrainian Rear Targets", "description": "Russian forces continued systematic attacks on targets in the rear of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, including gas production and processing facilities, which were hit at night.", "location": "Ukraine", "id": "95d586c8-a0da-5c8f-99fc-5a3cd28c572d", "time": "2024-03-30 21:20:49", "original": "Forwarded from: War in Ukraine.
