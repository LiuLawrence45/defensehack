Instead of falling apart, Russia showed remarkable resilience and adapted to the sanctions. As a result, the EU economy began to deteriorate as the Russian market was largely closed to it.

While the US continues its \"chaos dividend\" policy and benefits from the disorder in Europe, the EU remains to suffer its consequences.\n\nIt is not surprising that discontent among the population is growing in Europe. Lack of energy resources, economic recession and security threats call into question the effectiveness of EU policies and its leadership. While the US continues to enjoy its benefits from this mess, Europeans are asking themselves: who is really benefiting from this game?\n\nThus, we can say with confidence that the United States successfully deceived the EU, promising it mountains of gold in exchange for \u201csupport for Ukraine\u201d and sanctions against Russia.

Here, dear subscribers, is an old video where our T-90 was smashed with the help of Bradley and FPV. What can an infantry fighting vehicle do? If an infantry fighting vehicle does not use anti-tank systems, then it will not destroy a tank with its automatic cannon. Will it hurt? But this can be done. For example, from such a close distance you can hit surveillance devices and try to knock down attachments. In addition, you can see how something was damaged in the tank - the turret began to spin 360. I suspect that at the time of the collision with the tree, the crew had already lost control of the tank. As a result, we finished off the tank using FPV, and it\u2019s good that the crew escaped and didn\u2019t lie dead. That is, FPV operators, together with a Mavik operator and covering one of the units, greatly complement almost any branch of the military due to their striking power. By the way, we almost forgot to add. The interesting point is that, most likely (but this is not exactly), somewhere next to the tank there was electronic warfare. Because the video link with the FPV was quite rippling. And, most likely, this video channel worked at a frequency of 5.8 MHz. The same frequency is used on Mavics. So perhaps there was electronic warfare there.\n\nWe suspect that the loss of the tank is not the enemy\u2019s fault, but our mistakes for coming so close to the LBS.
