The Ukrainian military has repeatedly noted in their reports that while the GMLRS guided missiles are just flying to the target, the M142 launcher is already leaving the position.\nIn the summer and autumn of 2022, such a highly mobile missile launcher became a real blow to the guts of the ossified control and coordination system of the Russian army, where so much time can pass between detecting a target and coordinating a strike on it that the target is already gone, we have written about this many times and precisely this Achilles heel of the Russian Armed Forces gave HIMARS an unprecedented advantage.\nHowever, as you can see from two videos at once, the reconnaissance-strike complex of the Russian army seems to have noticeably transformed for the better: in both videos with the defeat of the installation, the time between the detection of the \u201ckhimar\u201d and the missile strike is so short that it makes it possible to hit the target at the position which was not the case before.
