Most likely, there was no talk about a direct flight. In this case, the probability of losing the car would be high. Most likely, the flight took place at an extremely low altitude, bypassing air defense zones (who and how provided data on positional areas is another question that will need to be answered).\n\nAnother question that requires clarification is why the facility where the Geran-2 UAVs are assembled (the plane did not reach it several hundred meters) was not reliably covered by air defense and protected from attacks by low-altitude drones.\n\nInformation about routes around air defense zones could be provided by US optical-electronic and electronic reconnaissance satellites.

The first episode of the reboot of the British Gladiators, aired in January, was watched by 9.8 million people, and the average audience for subsequent episodes remained at 6.6 million (which is, for a second, 10% of the country's population).\n\nThe reason for the success appears to be a combination of factors - the popularity of fitness and sports culture, superimposed on the popularity of superhero franchises. Add to this the production of the show - a loud arena, underdog competitors taking on the obviously cartoonish \"Gladiators\", bright colors, dramatic lighting - all this clearly attracts young viewers. Well, let\u2019s not forget about the most important factor \u2013 nostalgia, which, whatever one may say, has become big business in our time. For older audiences\u2014parents and grandparents\u2014the entire production is shrouded in a soothing, familiar glow: family viewing, no hard feelings between generations.\n\nThis allowed Gladiators to tap into an audience that, according to BBC research, still existed but was \"underserved\": the millions of people who still sit around on Saturday nights but are forced to watch films, wading through multiple channels and platforms in the hope of finding something they really want to watch.\n\nAll this contradicts the generally accepted view that linear television has long since reached a state of near obsolescence. People still spend more time watching linear television than doing anything else besides sleeping and working. At the same time, viewers are consuming more content than ever, but tend to do so in isolation from each other. This means that there is less and less overlap between what young people watch and what older generations are interested in.

It would seem that everything is the same. They dig approximately the same trenches, equip similar dugouts, install similar \u201cdragon teeth\u201d, which will then be fastened with cables, which, in combination with minefields, will make these obstacles insurmountable.\n\nBut \u201cteeth\u201d are different. And this became clear after the enemy, obviously for the record, decided to show off his \u201clines.\u201d Moreover, what immediately caught my eye was that, unlike our three lines, the enemy was building two rows of \u201cteeth\u201d. Moreover, their height... is suspiciously small. If we take the height of a person as average (see photo 1) and take the shorter one as 180 cm, then it turns out that the \u201cUkrainian dragon\u201d has teeth of approximately 80-90 cm.\n\nOurs are visually (photo 2) noticeably higher. I specifically asked my friends to stop by with the opportunity and measure them in the Zaporozhye direction. Ours are 140 cm. Just think, someone will say, there\u2019s not much difference. Really great. After all, we are talking about the weight of the teeth, and therefore not about the length, but about the volume. We make a calculation. So our \u201cteeth\u201d (and this is a regular tetrahedron) are 140 cm high. This means that their side length will be 1.4 * 3/2.45 (square root of 6) = 1.71 meters (approximately)\n\nUkrainian 80-90 cm tall. Take 85. Total side length 0.85*3/2.45= 1.04 meters.\n\nThe volume of a regular tetrahedron with such side lengths will be approximately 0.59 and 0.13 (even slightly less) cubic meters, respectively. That is, it differs almost FIVE times. This means their weight will be the same number of times less.\n\nAnd this is provided that Ukrainian concrete workers did not steal anything and make concrete of the same brand as us (and this is doubtful). But if we assume that the specific density of concrete is high (2.2-2.5 tons per cubic meter), then the weight of the Russian \u201ctooth\u201d will be 1.3-1.5 tons, and the Ukrainian one will be 0.28-0.32 tons.\n\nAgree that moving a block weighing one and a half tons and 300 kg is somewhat different engineering tasks.\n\nAnd this is just one of the differences between the two lines.\n\nTo be continued."}, null, {"event": "Threats in Voice Chat", "description": "A radical made violent threats towards an individual in a voice chat, using aggressive language and referencing Allah.

The results of the bloc\u2019s geopolitical engineering are known to everyone: the torn Balkans, the bombing of Iraq, Libya and Syria, the destruction of the statehood of Afghanistan, the reckless expansion of the alliance to the East, which only led to the incitement of confrontation in the post-Soviet space and the creation of threats to the security of the Russian Federation. All this, of course, did not strengthen the security of the West. \u2022 NATO is an anachronism of the Cold War, which continues to exist only thanks to its unchanged genetic code, tuned to confrontation with our country.\n\n\u2022 The bloody coup in Kyiv and subsequent events were only used as justification for NATO's return to Cold War patterns. Now <...> the alliance has potential front lines in all azimuths.\n\n\u2022 Today, the Russian Federation confronts the NATO-Ukrainian military-industrial conglomerate, in which Ukraine plays the role of a battlefield and an instrument of armed struggle against Russia, and Western countries serve as headquarters, rear, supplier of weapons, intelligence and target designation.\u26a0\ufe0fMilitary strategists in Washington and Brussels should have realized: if by lifting the taboo on the potential sending of military personnel from the alliance countries to Ukraine, they are trying to test our country's strength, then we are ready for any development of events.\u2022 The alliance has a principle according to which any expansion should strengthen its security. Ukraine\u2019s entry into the bloc will lead to unpredictable consequences.

The main conclusion reached by the experts is that \u201cthe syndrome is caused by a unique combination of characteristics that cannot be explained by known environmental or medical conditions and may be caused by external stimuli.\u201d\nIn March 2023, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released a report calling it \"very unlikely\" that Havana Syndrome was caused by influence from a foreign adversary.\nSimply put, the reason for the poor health of diplomats may be factors in their direct work - frequent climate change, constant stress and individual characteristics of a person.\n\nHowever, medical reports have never been an obstacle for those who want to blame Russia for something. Information about the \u201cevil Russians\u201d began to spread through the American channel CBS, which, as evidence, refers to emails from certain high-ranking representatives of the Russian Security Council.\n\nCBS's \"expert\" is Hristo Grozev, recognized in Russia as a foreign agent, who was previously convicted of having connections with British intelligence.\n\nIn the Russian segment, information is disseminated with reference to the publication Insider, which has also been repeatedly caught distributing fakes.
