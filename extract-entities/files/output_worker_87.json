On the same day, a peak of activity was observed in the wallet on the Tronscan platform. Tokens came there and left almost immediately.

Real disposable income of American households fell by 0.1% m/m in February, after zero dynamics in January and weak December, when inflation-adjusted incomes grew by only 0.2% m/m.\n\nAccordingly, during the winter season (Dec. 23-Feb. 24 inclusive), real disposable income increased by a symbolic 0.1% versus a record growth of 2.6% a year earlier. If we do not take the period of high inflation in 2022, from 2014 to 2020 (before the first lockdowns) During this period, real incomes grew by an average of 1.2%.\n\nThe result was weaker in the crisis year 2009 (minus 0.8%) and in the inflationary year 2022 (minus 2.5%), as well as in 2013 (minus 3.8%) due to the technical factor of additional dividend accrual in November, which distorted the calculation base by 4 percentage points.

It should be noted here that BEA revised down the volume of non-mortgage interest expenses from Oct.23 to Feb.24 with an accumulated total of an impressive 148 billion, which led to an overestimation of the savings rate by 0.25 percentage points due to manipulation with student loans.\n\nThe trend is negative. Incomes have actually stopped growing since May 2023 - growth in real terms is only 0.6%, savings rates are at historical lows, and interest expenses are steadily eating into household balance sheets, taking 2.6-2.8% of income, excluding mortgages vs 1.8-2% before cycle of tightening monetary policy.

The South Korean Institute of Fusion Energy (KFE) announced that it has achieved a new record for plasma confinement time by the KSTAR reactor. By December 2023, the reactor had undergone partial modernization, which raised the bar for its capabilities. The first three months of its operation in the new configuration allowed it to surpass the previous record of plasma confinement with a temperature of 100 million \u00b0 C and approach the new target.\n\nIn a previous series of experiments, the KSTAR fusion reactor was able to maintain ion plasma at a temperature of 100 million \u00b0C for 30 seconds. This is seven times hotter than the core of our Sun. In stars, thermonuclear fusion reactions are primarily driven not by temperature, but by extreme gravity (and quantum uncertainty). On Earth, we cannot create such gravitational compression in reactors, so we have to compensate for this deficiency with exorbitant temperatures.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that Koreans almost always talk about heating ion plasma - heating hydrogen atoms or its isotopes, while Chinese scientists report achieving a record confinement time for usually electron plasma, which in the working area can be twice as hot as ion plasma. For a thermonuclear reaction, the key is heating atoms, not electrons. Therefore, the \u201cKorean 100 million\u201d is the correct 100 million, which will ultimately determine the performance of future commercial reactors.@geonrgru|YouTube|sponsr.ru"}, null, null, null, {"event": "Intensive Training 'Special Purpose Mentors'", "description": "Instructors from the 'WARRIOR' Center conducted an intensive training program, 'Special Purpose Mentors', in the Tyumen region.

The Steelmaker Monument is one of the symbols of the city, dedicated to a specific person - steelmaker Makar Mazai. He holds the 1936 world record for removing steel from one square meter of furnace - 15.05 tons in 6 hours 30 minutes.

The housing is elite in appearance, but not in essence: any Mariupol resident who lost their home as a result of hostilities can get an apartment here. The old water tower with elegant pointed arches is more than 100 years old. In our time, it was converted into office space, but in 2022, like many buildings in the city, it suffered damage. Now the Russian authorities are engaged in its restoration. The Mariupol sea trade port is the sea gate of the city. Tons of construction materials for the restoration of Mariupol, grain and other goods necessary for the life and development of the DPR passed through this port. By the end of the year, the port's capacity will increase by 1 million tons of cargo.\n\nThe sister city of St. Petersburg is helping to develop Mariupol. Its governor Alexander Beglov presented Mariupol with a monument to Alexander Nevsky with a copy of the Bronze Horseman\u2019s horseshoe - you can rub it and make a wish.\n\nThe adventures of the raccoon continue tomorrow!
