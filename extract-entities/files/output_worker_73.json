However, someday they will probably accept it, just like for 2025 - even a replacement in the White House will not have time to change it much (then nothing will definitely be accepted in a year)\nAgainst the background of the cuts, the priorities of the American military are visible. Particularly important modernization programs and all topics related to countering China received full funding and maximum security.\nBut there is actually no conventional Ukrainian theme in the budget. In its main body, military assistance is minimal, even for the \u201cEuropean Deterrence Initiative\u201d (which involves the deployment of forces in Europe and part of the training) allocated three times less than for the \u201cPacific\u201d. It is much more interesting that the budget completely excludes large purchases of ammunition and modernization of the base for its production. Purchases of 155-mm shells are being cut against the backdrop of rising spending on sea mines (sic!).\nThe reason, in my opinion, is obvious - the budget was written against the backdrop of the nomination of the big \u201chundred-billionaire\u201d Biden to Congress, into which, amid budget cuts, the US military pushed everything they could. Now, without accepting it in some form, they will look very pale, since it turns out they themselves did not ask for a replacement for what they spent.\nWell, this means that I have always said that the variations of this bill have always been primarily about the American armed forces and the military-industrial complex, and not about anyone else.\nBy topic:\n- hyperoks are generally financed. ARRW is not in the budget, after all. LRHW and HACM make good money. MRC and Marine tomahawks continue to be produced\n- in the triad, B-21, LRSO and Columbia receive full support. Sentinel has been trimmed a bit, possibly amid overspending scandals\n- SLCM-N is not in the budget, but the NNSA request leaves the door open for it to appear if the FY2024 budget passes with it.

This \u201cpsyop\u201d is aimed primarily at supporting the morale of its soldiers on the front line. The fact is that the Su-34, armed with bombs with the UMPC system, became a real nightmare for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The UMPC (universal planning and adjustment module) is a product that was born in the shortest possible time in the conditions of the Northern Military District. This is a simple and effective mechanism that turns ordinary free-falling bombs into for various purposes (in common parlance - \u201ccast iron\u201d) into highly effective and high-precision weapons. The system is a module installed on any domestic bomb, turning it into a \u201csmart\u201d unmanned glider that carries this very bomb. A satellite navigation system is installed on board with an adaptive antenna that allows you to overcome interference from enemy electronic warfare systems. The use of such ammunition is carried out according to the \u201cfire and forget\u201d principle. That is, after being dropped several tens of kilometers before the target, the bomber crew can immediately make a combat turn, thereby avoiding a long stay in the enemy\u2019s air defense zone. Apparently, manufacturing a set of UMPC and a conventional free-falling bomb is several orders of magnitude cheaper than a full-fledged adjustable aerial bomb (KAB).At the same time, there are already options for similar modules for installation not only on the \u201ctraditional\u201d FAB-500, but also on the much more powerful FAB-1500.

Over the past week alone, the rating for the Noon Against Putin campaign increased by 1.5%.\n\nExperts associate such changes in the ranking with the death of Alexei Navalny and the refusal to register Boris Nadezhdin as a candidate.\n\nThe rating of the State Duma Vice Speaker, presidential candidate from the New People party, Vladislav Davankov, is also growing. The ratings of the remaining candidates \u2013 Leonid Slutsky and Nikolai Kharitonov \u2013 are in a state of stagnation.\n\nThe Future of Russia project emphasizes that the Internet rating may differ from the results of field research, but it is representative and reflects the general dynamics of Russians\u2019 sympathies. The ranking takes into account only the choice of users voting in Russia.\n\n\u201cThe Future of Russia\u201d is an initiative of independent sociologists to monitor the election campaign for the presidential elections in the Russian Federation in 2024.

Initially, I thought that there was no intrigue in the elections in Senegal, but this story with the postponement of the elections, the failure of the president\u2019s plan and the \u201creturn of the opposition\u201d proves that there is - and it is not clear how strong the main candidates are now really in their support from voters and administrators. #SenegalTelegramAfrican Through the Looking GlassNikita Panin's channel about political processes in Africa\n\nThe author is the RIAC program coordinator and an expert at the Center for African Studies at the Higher School of Economics VIEW CHANNEL"}, {"event": "US Assistance to Ukraine", "description": "The United States is providing $300 million in assistance to Ukraine, correcting earlier reports of $400 million.
