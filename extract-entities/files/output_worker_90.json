Applications can be submitted until April 12, with funding available up to 150 million rubles for UAS weighing 30-500 kg and up to 250 million rubles for heavier UAS.", "location": "Moscow, Russia", "id": "ad3d813d-2dd0-5a51-839a-628c6ad44842", "time": "2024-03-30 13:16:27", "original": "Forwarded from: Andrey Patrakov RunAvia\nCertification for the sake of certification Yesterday, March 26, the Ministry of Industry and Trade announced that it is ready to issue grants to those companies that would like to certify the unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) developed or produced by them, but do not have the opportunity to finance it from their own pocket. Applications can be submitted until April 12. Certification, according to laws of the Russian Federation are subject to UAS weighing more than 30 kilograms. In the category of drones from 30 to 500 kg, the Ministry of Industry and Trade is ready to allocate funding up to 150 million rubles; developers and manufacturers of heavy UAS - from 500 kilograms and above can receive up to 250 million rubles.\n\nThe grant recipient must implement his project within two years. This is one of the first problems of the competition. Currently, only one drone is listed in the register of UAS that have received a type certificate - BAS-200. It was certified by the national helicopter manufacturing center Mil and Kamov, a state-owned enterprise that is part of Russian Helicopters, a subsidiary of Rostec. With all the capabilities and resources of the state corporation, certification took a year and a half. As Mashnews previously wrote, the actual cost of certification of the BAS-200 was 142 million rubles. In reality, all the work cost about a billion rubles. Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation Andrei Belousov reported this to President Putin. \u201cThe cost of the procedure was 150 million rubles, and taking into account the creation of prototypes and a bench base, according to the manufacturer, about one billion rubles. It is clear that for the vast majority of manufacturers this is an absolutely unaffordable amount,\u201d the official summed up at a meeting with the head of state. Experts have already noticed that the Ministry of Industry and Trade does not seem to want \u201cjust anyone\u201d to become the owner of the subsidy. For example, AviaComments writes in their channel that those who did not know about the competition in advance may not make it in time, since the submission deadline is limited to April 12 (Cosmonautics Day). Today, March 27, the Ministry of Industry and Trade announced that it will begin accepting applications only on April 1. The department will begin reviewing them on April 16 and intends to finish on May 6. The winners will be announced within a week.\n\nJudging by the amounts available to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, it will not be possible to help many. In 2024, it is planned to allocate 475 million rubles, in 2025 - 884.6 million, in 2026 - 675 million.\n\nLegal entities without overdue debts to the budget will be able to receive this money; the authorized capital cannot contain more than 25% of foreign participation; the organization must not have the status of a foreign agent, be recognized as extremist and involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These are fairly standard requirements for participation in competitions for receiving budget funding. Support from the Ministry of Industry and Trade is, in general, not a new thing, and previously it was possible to receive compensation for certification. For more than 10 years, there has been the possibility of compensation for the costs of certification of aviation equipment in the Ministry of Industry and Trade, but none of the private companies (according to my information) have ever taken advantage of these opportunities. The fact is that first the development company must certify the aircraft at its own expense, and only then can it receive this compensation. Over the past 15 years in the Russian Federation there has not been a single certified aircraft by a private company. The reason is the high cost and timing of type certification, which makes private projects of new aircraft in the Russian Federation economically unfeasible. This is one of the reasons for the death of small aviation in our country. The same reason is now holding back the beginning of the development of the unmanned segment of small civil aviation in Russia.\n\nIt is still difficult to judge the new procedure for submitting an application to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, because there is no practice on it yet. But the deadline until April 12, which is significantly less than a month from the date of public announcement, looks very short. Those who did not know in advance about this possibility are not sure that they will have time to prepare documents and go through all the bureaucratic procedures for submitting an application.

Some infrastructure facilities will be modernized, for example, existing runways at airports will be expanded. It is noteworthy that half of the facilities are located in Okinawa Prefecture on the southwestern island of Kyushu. They are located closest to Taiwan and the Senkaku Islands, control over which is disputed by both Japan and China.\n\nBy the way, the media began to write more and more about the latter territories, since last year the PRC began to actively confirm its sovereignty over them by sending its ships there. The Japanese also frequently conduct joint exercises with the United States in relative proximity to the Senkaku Islands.\n\nIn general, these plans coincide with the general course of the Japanese government to strengthen the country's defensive potential. However, it is still not clear whether they will be implemented - there have been no official statements from the country's authorities. Providing access to civilian infrastructure should take place after negotiations with the local population. Residents of the same Okinawa prefecture are often negatively disposed towards such initiatives. Therefore, we should not exclude the possibility that the government\u2019s likely plans may be postponed indefinitely due to citizens\u2019 dissatisfaction.\n\nAt the same time, there is no doubt that the US armed forces will also have access to the infrastructure. Moreover, recently one of Washington\u2019s goals is to expand military influence in the Asia-Pacific region.

But sociologists conducted experiments and found that if you ask not about torture in general, but propose a specific situation, it turns out that many are ready to recognize torture as acceptable. As in the famous thought experiment: a terrorist planted a bomb somewhere in a crowded place, he was caught, the bomb was not found - can he be tortured to find out where it is?\n\nFor the Israeli intelligence service Shin Bet, this is not a thought experiment, but an everyday work issue. There are special departmental instructions, court decisions on this matter, and a public discussion that has been going on for 40 years. Of course, it is impossible to directly compare the Israeli situation with the Russian one. But some parallels may still be instructive.\n\nIn the latest letter from the Signal email newsletter, we tell you how Israel has legalized \u201cmoderate physical influence\u201d on terrorism suspects and what justifications the country\u2019s most authoritative lawyers find for this.

The construction of this temple is the passion of some radical Jewish groups who believe that it will lead to the coming of the messiah.\n\nHowever, the proposed site for this temple, the Temple Mount in Jerusalem's Old City, is also home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock Temple, two of the holiest sites in Islam. This convergence of religious significance has long been a flashpoint in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThe arrival of these red cows did not go unnoticed by Palestinian factions.\n\nIn a recent speech marking the 100th anniversary of the Gaza war, a Hamas spokesman accused Jews of bringing red cows to the Holy Land, linking them to the ongoing conflict. Some Jews see cows as an integral part of rebuilding the ancient Jewish temple, while others see them as a provocative symbol of Israeli expansionism in the West Bank.\n\nThe transport of these cows was facilitated by Yitzhak Mamo, a member of Uvne Jerusalem, a group working to build a new temple in the Old City of Jerusalem. Mamo overcame legal hurdles to transport the heifers from Texas to the West Bank, highlighting the seriousness of their role in fulfilling Bible prophecy. They are scheduled to be sacrificed on a huge white altar overlooking the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. This ceremony is intended to reflect the rituals of ancient times and fulfill religious prophecies."}, null, null, {"event": "Attacks on Gaza Strip", "description": "The Gaza Strip's Ministry of Health reported a death toll of 32,705 and 75,200 injuries due to attacks.
