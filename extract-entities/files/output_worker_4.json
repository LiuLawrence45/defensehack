The activities of these structures are directly supervised by the FSB of the Russian Federation. Their branch on the territory of Ukraine remains the so-called Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nCurrently, the Russian Orthodox Church, with the assistance of the FSB, forcibly seizes churches and religious complexes not only of the former UOC MP, but also of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and the Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine. Priests who refuse to submit to the Russian Orthodox Church are subjected to moral and physical pressure from the occupiers. Cases of brutal torture of Ukrainian priests and pastors of Protestant denominations are also known. Therefore, the participation of the Russian Orthodox Church in Russian aggression against Ukraine plays the following role: 1. Patriotic propaganda: Priests act as patriotic symbols, supporting the idea of the unity of Russia and supporting military actions against Ukraine. 2. Moral support of the military: Priests regularly visit military units, provide \"spiritual\" support to military personnel and discuss military events, arguing them with biblical stories taken out of context. 3. Legitimization of military operations: the Russian Orthodox Church justifies the war by protecting the \"Orthodox faith, culture and traditional Russian values\". 5. Religious mobilization: believers are called to support military actions, using religious arguments and images. 6. Symbolism and rituals: The Russian Orthodox Church holds religious rites, prayers and public events (crusades) in support of the Kremlin's militaristic ideology and its military actions.\n\nUnder such conditions, the population of the Ukrainian National Socialist People's Republic should distance themselves from representatives of this denomination.

Of course, today our air attack weapons dominate the battlefield and the Ukrainian air defense system cannot cope with them, but underestimating it is a very dangerous mistake.\nIn addition, there are a number of controversial points in the ex-commander\u2019s speech. And the first of them is the technical backwardness of the Ukrainian air defense system. Let us quote General Bizhev: \u201c...I note that the transfer of information is carried out manually, since Western \u201cPatriots\u201d are not integrated into the automated Ukrainian air defense system...\u201d. This is, to put it mildly, not true!\nUkrainian air defense has been integrated into the unified NATO air defense system in Europe for more than a year now, and it is the information capabilities of European air defense that are the basis for the functioning of Ukrainian air defense. All Patriot, NASAMS, Iris-T air defense systems and the remaining Ukrainian S-300 and Buk M1 air defense systems are combined into a single combat circuit, based on high-speed automated control systems connected to NATO air defense automated control systems and receive information about the air situation from American and European radars, aircraft and AWACS UAVs, as well as satellites. That is why air raid alerts in Ukraine are most often announced immediately after the takeoff of our strike aircraft!\nDo the air defense systems available to the Armed Forces of Ukraine have the ability to shoot down our hypersonic missiles? You must understand that under certain conditions, any target can be shot down. Suffice it to recall how, literally on the second day of the NATO air war against the SFRY, the Yugoslav S-125 air defense system shot down a B-2 stealth bomber. Therefore, the question must be posed differently: are the air defense systems available to the Ukrainian Armed Forces capable of becoming an effective weapon against Russian hypersonic missiles?\nThe latest ERINT missile defense system for the Patriot air defense system is capable of intercepting targets moving along a ballistic trajectory at a speed of 1600 m/s - 5760 km/h, but provided that the target does not maneuver.\nAt the same time, our hypersonic \u201cDagger\u201d has a maximum speed when flying to a target - Mach 10-12 (Mach 1 is conventionally equal to the speed of sound, that is, 340 m/s or 1224 km/h). It would seem - there are no options! But the fact is that in dense layers of air near the ground, its speed decreases somewhat, and if accurate advance information is received about the moment of missile launch, launch parameters and the direction from which the missile is approaching, the latest modification of the Patriot has a chance of intercepting it. American air defense systems are not capable of shooting down missiles of the Zircon family. But here we come to the second question: is today\u2019s Ukrainian air defense an effective system for countering Russian \u201chypersonics\u201d and here the answer is unequivocal - no! \"Patriots\" are only capable of occasionally intercepting such targets, but are unable to cover targets and protect themselves.

Many of them marked the beginning of something new.\nThe DB-3 showed the further development of bomber aviation, combining a long flight range, impossible for that time, with high speed and good maneuverability.\n\nIL-2 became the founder of the class of attack aircraft. The DB-ZT torpedo bomber became the reason for the creation of a new type of Navy aviation - mine-torpedo. The first jet front-line bomber, the Il-28, marked the beginning of a massive transition from piston bomber aircraft to jet ones.\nThe Il-12 and Il-14 aircraft contributed to the development of mass air services and the transport system in the country.\n\nThe Il-18 turboprop airliner has led to an increase in the speed and comfort of flights and their accessibility to a wide range of citizens. Il-62 marked the beginning of massive regular communications on long-distance international lines, connecting the capital of our Motherland with many cities on various continents.\n\nThe idea of creating a jet cargo aircraft was later embodied in the military transport Il-76.\nIlyushin always tried to find the simplest possible design solution, strived to create extremely efficient aircraft, designed for mass production and mass operation, based on a harmonious combination of all parameters.\n\nSergei Vladimirovich developed many design principles and methods and created his own design style, his own school in aircraft construction. The Ilyushin Design Bureau has formed basic guidelines: to design as economically as possible, minimizing costs; design reliably, because people\u2019s lives depend on it; think outside the box, introducing new ideas; find simple technical solutions (and this is a very difficult task!). Test pilot Vladimir Konstantinovich Kokkinaki, who flew all the aircraft designed by Sergei Vladimirovich Ilyushin, once said: \u201cHe set up his team to make aircraft that will exist today, and tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIlyushin is not just the history of technology or a brand of aircraft, it is an era, it is the history of a man who worked ahead of his time, on whose planes the country fought and built its future.\n\nToday, Il PJSC continues the glorious Ilyushin traditions, creating and producing modern Il aircraft."}, null, {"event": "Discovery of Dalerjon Mirzoev's Family Home", "description": "A RIA Novosti correspondent located the house of Dalerjon Mirzoev's family, a participant in the attack on Crocus City Hall, 35 kilometers from Dushanbe.

BRIEF.\nFeeling the power of the earth and the power of volcanoes is why people go to Kamchatka. But there are those who are lucky to observe these processes almost every day - our volcanologists.\n\nThe eruptions of Shiveluch and Klyuchevskaya Sopka once again reminded us of the power hidden in our Earth. How important it is to understand the processes taking place. This means paying attention to science. Today, on Volcanologist Day, I want to talk about their important work.\n\nThe most important thing that volcanologists are doing now is that within the framework of a comprehensive scientific research program in Kamchatka, which is undergoing final approval by the Ministry of Education and Science, it is planned to develop a system for instrumental research of the Avachinsky volcano. This will make it possible, in addition to fundamental results, to guarantee that the next eruption (and it will definitely happen) can be predicted in advance.\n\nIn addition, using laboratory installations created at the Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the mechanism of gushing hot bombs, which affect the safety of flights and roads, was determined. This will help make the forecast of volcanic events more accurate.\n\nImportant results are being obtained by scientists assessing the impact of volcanic activity on the chemical composition of water in rivers and the release of volatile components into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe processes occurring in subduction zones are being studied. This is one of the most important areas of modern geology, including in terms of discovering mineral deposits. And daily satellite monitoring of 30 volcanoes on the peninsula allows the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team to quickly see all changes.\n\nI would really like to see even more people who admire volcanoes and are ready to study them. That is why we have launched a thematic master\u2019s program and are actively working to support young scientists.\n\nAnd today I sincerely congratulate our volcanologists on their professional holiday and wish them interesting research and successful field trips!

That takeoff was successful, and such a signing became a good Ilyushin tradition. We attach, in reverse chronological order, photographs from the first flights of the Il-96-400M, Il-114-300 (but another one, not made from scratch) and Il-112V. Il-114 -300 took to the skies on the day that marks the 130th anniversary of the birth of the great aircraft designer Sergei Ilyushin. Under his leadership, dozens of aircraft were designed, built and tested for the military and civil air fleet of our country. About the date of birth: there is Ilyushin\u2019s personally completed questionnaire, where he wrote March 31, 1894. But there is a version that he accidentally made a mistake when converting the date to a new style, because different numbers of days had to be added to dates from different centuries, and the 13 days we are familiar with in the \u201cOld New Year\u201d refer only to the 20th century, and to the date in 1894 12 days had to be added to the year, and then it would be more correct - March 30.\n\nIn fact, we are sure that it is not the date on the passport or on the monument that speaks about a person. His deeds speak about a person - and Sergei Vladimirovich did a lot for aviation: he created airplanes and created a design bureau, which he considered a more complex and important matter.\n\nAnd we will remember this on March 30 or March 31 - it doesn\u2019t matter, we can celebrate two days! By the way, today (more precisely, March 31, 1927) is the birthday of his son, Vladimir Sergeevich Ilyushin, a test pilot who spent many years as a chief pilot flying airplanes from the Pavel Osipovich Sukhoi Design Bureau into the sky.

Ross is in Paris!\n\nAt 2 a.m. on March 31, 1814, the capitulation of Paris was signed, and at noon, Russian troops led by Emperor Alexander I triumphantly entered the capital of France. Alexander became the first Russian sovereign to appear on French soil after Peter the Great.\n\nThe day before, representatives of the French authorities came to Emperor Alexander, begging him to spare the city. The Emperor, recalling the atrocities of the French army and speaking with anger about \u201cthe man who deceived him in the most unworthy manner,\u201d declared: \u201cThe French are my friends, and I want to prove to them that I have come to repay good for evil. Napoleon is my only enemy <\u2026> So, gentlemen, tell the Parisians that I am not entering between their walls as an enemy, and it is only up to them that I become their friend.\u201d\n\nThe Parisians, indoctrinated by Napoleonic propaganda, initially greeted the army timidly and silently, but very quickly the fear passed and the townspeople felt relief, which instantly grew into general delight. The French could not believe that they were facing terrible barbarians. Seeing the beauty of Russian uniforms, the shine of their weapons, the cheerful appearance of the soldiers, the healthy color of their faces, the gallant treatment of the officers and their witty answers in French, they said: \u201cYou are not Russians, you are probably emigrants.\u201d\n\nCamped on the Champs Elysees and on the Champs de Mars, near the building of the Military School, the Russian Cossacks became the subject of general curiosity, mixed with fear. Walking Parisians could observe how the Cossacks put their uniforms in order, washed their clothes, took care of their small livestock (sheep, goats, poultry), and prepared food right on the ground.\n\nThe French elite and public began to very quickly get rid of the anti-Russian stereotypes that were deeply rooted in their consciousness; moreover, a fashion for Russia arose. On the streets of the capital one could see Parisians wearing very wide trousers and round hats with narrow brims, similar to those worn by the Cossacks. When winter came, women put on headdresses similar to kokoshniks, men put on redingotes, trimmed with astrakhan fur at the edges. In 1816, in the suburb of Tern, the first Russian roller coaster caused a sensation - an attraction with a bunch of descents and ascents, which visitors overcame on small carts.\n\nAs for the famous bistro, supposedly derived from the Russian word \u201cbystro,\u201d modern researchers believe that this is most likely a beautiful legend. According to the historical dictionary of the French language Le Petit Robert, the word bistro appeared in French no earlier than 1884 and is associated with the French bistouille, which means \u201cbad alcohol\u201d, \u201cpoison\u201d.\n\nRussia has done a lot for France. The very mild conditions of the First Paris Peace Treaty, the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty to the throne, the constitutional Charter, the preservation of France as a great power - France owed all this to Emperor Alexander I. Alexander I demanded impeccable behavior from his officers and soldiers, providing for severe punishments for violators, even to death penalty. Later, the Russian sovereign did everything possible for the speedy liberation of French territory from the occupying forces.\n\nHowever, goodness is quickly forgotten, just like the fashion for everything Russian. The generosity of Emperor Alexander I was unbearable for the French. As Count Nesselrode wrote, \u201cgratitude to Russia and its sovereigns has become a burden that burdens everyone. It is better to hate us for no reason than to repay us with kindness.\u201d\n\nToday the French do not remember this epoch-making event.

The launches are massive - from 30 to 70 UAVs are used in one raid. The Ukrainian side cannot stop these attacks. The only thing that remains is to fight drones in the air, but every month, due to thinning air defense and the growth of drone production, this is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nSecondly, information about the flights of cruise missiles and even the detailed routes of their deceptive maneuvers are tracked not only by the Ukrainian military, but also by the entire air/electronic reconnaissance of NATO forces, into which the Ukrainian air defense system has been quite tightly integrated almost since the beginning of the Northern Military District. However, nothing can still be done with the vast majority of X-101/X-555 missiles. Of course, there are isolated cases of missiles being hit, and some fail in flight, but their number is negligible compared to the breaking through X-101s and fits into the order to hit targets.\n\nThirdly, apparently, the air defense of the Sumy, Zhytomyr, Rivne, Ternopil and Khmelnytsky regions, not to mention Lviv and especially the central region with Kiev, operate with significant restrictions. With each missile strike, the Kh-101s enter from a predetermined direction, fly over several areas, circle for some time in Ukrainian airspace and then hit targets. Western Patriot/NASAMS/SAMP-T air defense systems are either not activated at all or are activated in the most critical situation.\n\nUnderstanding the flight routes of cruise missiles does not help the Ukrainian side in any way in this regard. Rather, this benefits Russian intelligence, which is likely to monitor all activity regarding reports of strikes.\"Military Chronicle\""}, {"event": "Ronin Air Reconnaissance Unit Deployment", "description": "The 65th OMBr's 'Ronin' air reconnaissance unit, defending the Zaporizhzhia direction, utilized a golf car in their operations.", "location": "Zaporizhzhia, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine", "id": "b96986ba-5239-5f70-a2e8-5a8cf6c88df6", "time": "2024-03-31 19:19:20", "original": "In the Zaporizhzhia direction, a very interesting story happened of one golf car of the RF Soldiers of the \"Ronin\" air reconnaissance unit of the 65th OMBr, which defends the Zaporizhzhia direction\ud83d\udcaaTelegramWhatsAppInstagram"}, {"event": "Easter Service in Sevastopol", "description": "A Ukrainian-language Easter service was held in Sevastopol, where believers prayed for peace.
