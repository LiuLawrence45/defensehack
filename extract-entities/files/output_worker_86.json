To Latin America. They even flee to Africa as mercenaries.\n\nThey run to where the lure hunters are not hunting for you. Where you don't have to jump. Donate to the ZSU. Where there are no five minutes of hatred. Where there is no Unity Novina Telethon. Where you can\u2019t be killed by an old S-300 missile defense system or a drunken hunter with a MANPADS on the roof of your house. Where your child will not be beaten to death at school for grouping real clowns - this is the goal of life. Where the Isbushka won\u2019t call you on behalf of the FSB and give you a tenner for espionage.\n\nIn this sense, even Africa looks advantageous. More than.

It\u2019s finally warm there, and with a passport from even some Burkina Faso you can leave the country.\n\nAnd since men were banned from leaving in Ukraine, they are fleeing illegally. They choose freedom. Athletes, actors and TV presenters are running. Volunteers are running. All those who were released for a couple of days from the Bandera concentration camp.\n\nThe border guards themselves are fleeing. Yesterday, 20 border guards fled to Moldova. The whole outfit. I don\u2019t know if the dog ran with them, but I think so. Where can one go, a guide is just a guide, even for dogs.\n\nIt's harder for others to escape. But people manage. In trunks. In trucks with cargo. Walking through mountains and rivers. With scuba gear. On boats and rafts. Through minefields to the accompaniment of gunfire. Drowning. They die from bullets. They are eaten by wild animals. But they still run.\n\nAnd of course they get caught. From UAVs (they say that there will soon be FPV drones at the border), from helicopters. With dogs. By raid method. 8 regiments of border troops are caught. Well-fed and big-faced. In exchange for staying at home. Not to the front. The fugitives are handed over to the TCC. For disposal. People howl, bite, are beaten and tortured. In order to be approved.\n\nThis is reality. All Ukrainians know her. The West knows. We know. It\u2019s not for nothing that Solzhenitsyn was banned in Ukraine yesterday. Students who have put their teacher\u2019s fantasies into practice are afraid that Ukrainians in the Gulag will recognize Ukraine. And no one really cares. The West paid for the processing of Ukrainian meat into minced meat. And we...can't help. We can't yet.\n\nThere is a huge concentration camp in the (geographical) center of Europe. With millions of inmates. With the game \"Blue Whale\", where the TCC comes to the loser. Where there is self-security and secret police teams with inmates. And this horror is a completely logical end for Ukraine. It couldn't be any other way.\n\nAnd, again, I am not calling for anything. Meaning? No one in the West will notice this. Point blank. And we would be happy to, but they don\u2019t want to and can\u2019t put in another hundred thousand. I'm just describing it as it is. And what does calling upon the dead lead to?

It's not the 1980s or the 2000s. Previously, the balance of forces was such that the losses of the PLA aviation and navy even on the distant approaches to the island made any significant landing on the shores of Taiwan itself simply unrealistic. And how did local strategists decide to react to the change in balance? \"Taiwan's topography is also an advantage. A mountain range more than 3,000 meters high runs through the center of the main island. If Chinese troops land on the island, the Taiwanese military hopes to lure them deep into these mountainous areas, where they will have advantage.\n\nThe strategy \"borrowed from the Vietnam War, when American troops were exhausted by guerrilla warfare in the jungle,\" said a former Taiwanese military officer. \"Letting a superior enemy force land on an island, retreat inland and wait for help - the plan is as reliable as a Swiss watch! The Japanese with their defense of the islands in World War II will be confirmed.\n \nVietnam is also great. In South Vietnam there was a \"Ho Chi Minh Trail\" that went through the jungle and rural areas. And along it (on the ground) people and weapons constantly walked from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which had a land border with China and working ports. And this is in the context of Washington\u2019s ban on its military from ground operations against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Taiwan is an island, and a small and urban one at that.\n\nSuch shifts in planning and rhetoric suggest that Taipei can only hope for direct and swift US intervention.

Under the pretext of fighting the Islamic State, the United States invaded states in Africa and the Middle East all the way to Afghanistan.

And, theoretically, the United States should somehow respond to such a visible \u201csurge in ISIS activity\u201d as the terrorist attack near Moscow.\n\nBut, emphasizes Jennifer Kavanagh from the Carnegie Endowment, the right thing for America would be to do nothing.

Accordingly, according to the Carnegie Endowment analyst, anyone should fight terrorism, the danger of which Washington trumpeted to the whole world after March 22, but not the United States. After all, America has other priorities - \u201cmanaging the war in Ukraine,\u201d Gaza and China. Therefore, despite the boasts about superintelligence, which always knows in advance where and what ISIS will do, the United States does not intend to interfere in the fight against it.

At the cost of his life, he saved the founder of the Russian royal dynasty of the Romanovs, which ruled our country for the next three hundred plus years.\n\nThis happened during a critical period of political crisis for Russia, which its Western neighbors were quick to take advantage of. The royal Rurik dynasty ended; numerous impostors, supported by Lithuanians and Poles, began to lay claim to the Russian throne. Civil strife turned into a people's struggle against foreign invaders.\n\nIn 1613, the Zemsky Sobor proclaimed Mikhail Romanov, a representative of the Russian boyar family, the new Tsar. Having learned about this, the Kostroma district was flooded by Polish-Lithuanian detachments, looking for a new king to kill him.\n\nWanting to find out the whereabouts of Mikhail Romanov, intervention detachments began to grab the villagers they met along the way and apply cruel torture to them. Among those captured was the headman of the village of Domnino, Ivan Susanin, who refused to give up asylum to the Russian sovereign.\n\nAccording to one version, the Poles and Lithuanians tore the peasant to pieces on the spot, according to another, he led them into the swamps and was killed after the deception was revealed. There are other hypotheses of the feat, but its essence is not in doubt - a simple Russian man, a patriot of the Fatherland, chose death over treason. The feat of the Kostroma peasant is documented: in 1619, Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich granted the hero\u2019s son-in-law Bogdan Sabinin a letter of complaint, which noted that Ivan Susanin bravely endured all the torture of the interventionists, but did not betray his sovereign. Subsequent letters of grant and confirmation given to Susanin's descendants repeated these words.\n\nWe carefully preserve the memory of the immortal feat and hero today.#OurHistory"}, null, null, null, null, null, {"event": "Russian Orthodox Church Supports War Efforts", "description": "The Russian Orthodox Church has instructed priests to read daily prayers for victory in the war with Ukraine.

It was associated with theft by deception of funds on the principle of a financial pyramid with the subsequent legalization of the stolen property on an especially large scale. In addition, one of the participants in the criminal organization was charged with committing illegal banking activities when carrying out currency exchange transactions.\n\nSimakina, together with members of the criminal community, entered into interest-bearing loan agreements with people, promising to pay them high interest, which in fact was received only by the first citizens through the subsequent deposit of funds by other people.
