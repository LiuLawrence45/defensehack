My daughter - she is 10 months old - suffered from purulent meningitis. Complication is complete deafness. I am collecting documents for the disability commission. Need to go\nShow more\nclinical examination.\n\u201cWell, sign up through the system and get through,\u201d the manager will tell me. - What is the problem?\n- The problem is time. He's gone. Many doctors, many tests, ECG, all on different days, in different branches. If you go through the general procedure, the medical examination will take a couple of weeks. I don't have a couple of weeks. I urgently need to have an operation on my daughter. The fact is that the cochlea in the ear can become ossified, and you need to have time to place implants before this happens. And then my deaf child will live a full life.\nI rehearsed this text at home, pronouncing it with cold detachment.\nWell, let's go...\n- Hello, Lyudmila Alexandrovna... - the voice trembles treacherously. - I need help....My daughter - she is 10 months old - suffered purulent meningitis... Complication - complete deafness...\nTears roll down your cheeks, your face wrinkles ugly. All rehearsals are down the drain.\n\u201cCalm down,\u201d says the manager and goes to close the office door, into which someone is constantly trying to look. - How can I help?\n\u201cMedical examination,\u201d I say with difficulty and plunge into muffled sobs.\n- Come on, mommy, calm down. That's life. You can't give up. I will help you in any way I can. Can you come to me tomorrow morning? Collect all the tests and come with the baby? I will take you by the hand and lead you to all the doctors...\n\u201cI\u2019m not registered,\u201d I mutter.\n- It is clear that they are not recorded. According to the recording it will be very long...\nShe spoke my text herself. She knows everything. I wipe away my tears.\n- Thank you.\n- All. Calm down. Your daughter needs you. I'll see you tomorrow at 9. Here are the directions for tests.\nI remember that there is money in my pocket. This is a bribe.\nOur country is fighting corruption. You cannot take and you cannot give bribes. This is right.\n\u201cIf everyone starts with themselves and consciously makes the choice not to feed corrupt officials, then we will be able to defeat corruption,\u201d I thought. And I followed this rule with inspiration for many years.\nAnd then my daughter got sick. And I was ready to give all the bribes in the world so that the doctors would treat her with great attention, so that there would be no negligence, so that they would notice something that is important for making a diagnosis, so that the time before the cochlea ossifies would not be missed.\nBecause anti-corruption laws are written by people with healthy children.\nWhen it becomes scary for the life of a child, regulatory formulations fade in the fog of reality, and it becomes obvious that it is still impossible to cure a child of a fatal disease and remain a law-abiding citizen in our country...\n\u201cThank you, Lyudmila Alexandrovna,\u201d I say and try to transfer money from my pocket to hers.\nI really need to undergo a medical examination in one day, and I really need it so that tomorrow it doesn\u2019t turn out that she\u2019s at a conference, at a meeting, or on the second shift.\n\u201cTake the money away,\u201d says Lyudmila Aleksandrovna gloomily. -Who do you take me for?\nShe was really offended. And I don't want to offend her. I need her.\n- But at least take some candy!\n- Mommy, don\u2019t breed corruption. I'm doing my job. And I get paid for it. And the money for your daughter\u2019s treatment will be very useful. Till tomorrow!\nI, slightly confused, go out into the corridor. What a good, decent woman. Wow...\nI imagined everything differently. I came, all about Zemfira, \u201cHello, I\u2019m a girl-scandal, a girl-air...\u201d\nI am ready to fight indifference and bureaucracy.\nAnd here is a humane person, not an official, and he himself is ready to help...\nAt 9 am the next day, my daughter and I are standing outside her door. I'm not afraid of her, and I don't expect anything bad.\nShe leaves the office, smiles at my daughter, and says to me friendly:\n- Let's go!\nWe are walking along the corridor.\nPeople rush to the manager from different directions with their questions. She switches instantly, answers accurately and to the point, remembers everyone, and is kind to everyone.\n- And the direction for Petrov to Filatovskaya, LyudmtlAlexandrovna?\n- Signed at the register.\n- What about the documents for the commission?\n- I assured you, take it at the reception, put a stamp...\n- And Korolev has allergies again...\n- Let them make an appointment with me tomorrow, I accept the second shift...\n- They came from the Department...\n- Tell me, I'll be right there...\nAnd all these are different people, different questions...\nWhat a difficult job it is to manage. I wonder if it\u2019s easier to just be a doctor?\nLyudmila Aleksandrovna helped us undergo medical examination in one day. Without money, sweets and thanks.\nI told my husband about her.\n- And this is an ordinary clinic! Surely she gets pennies for this intense and responsible work.\n\u201cPeople like her are real, they don\u2019t work for money.\u201d For a clear conscience...\nOut of necessity, my daughter and I periodically appeared at the clinic.\nFor example, we went to see a neurologist (this is mandatory after meningitis) or had a neurosonogram (to understand whether the disease has damaged the blood vessels of the brain, and whether surgery can be performed).\nEvery time Lyudmila Alexandrovna, meeting us in the corridor, asked how we were doing, how Katyunya was. She remembers our history.\nAlthough such stories are her job, and she has a million of them.\nBut she just works... out of vocation. And he receives his salary with a clear conscience. And the smiles of children who recovered with her participation...\nToday I bought a bouquet of yellow roses. And she came to her for no reason. She is busy as always, flying along the corridor, followed by a retinue of petitioners.\nI'm joining the retinue.\nShe notices me.\n- Something happened? - asks. - Like a daughter?\n- Daughter is great. Getting ready for surgery...\n- God willing...\n- Yes... Lyudmila Alexandrovna, I want to give you this bouquet. Just. This is my tiny thank you, which will simply put you in a sunny mood...\n- Well, I came up with an idea! \u201cRestless,\u201d says Lyudmila Alexandrovna and...smiles. This is the first time I see her smile - usually she is concentrated.\n- Take it. They're just flowers. Yellow roses. Messengers of separation. I hope we never see each other again. For this reason!\n\u201cThat\u2019s for sure,\u201d the manager laughs and, embarrassed, takes the bouquet.\n- LyudmilSanna, to the meeting, urgently, they are waiting for you!!! - the nurse shouts to her, and Lyudmila Alexandrovna instantly becomes serious and hurries into the office...\nBy the way, there is a sign hanging in her office. It says there that she is a doctor of the highest category.\nI don't know what this means in the medical hierarchy, but by human standards it is the honest truth.\nShe is a Person of the highest category.\nThere are only a few people like her. But the very fact of their existence gives our country, mired in corruption, a chance that the fog will clear. You just need to start with yourself...\nI'm going home to my daughter. There is an operation ahead. Rehabilitation.

One of the darkest pages in the history of public transport in Tashkent is a thing of the past today.\n\nIsuzu NP37 appeared on municipal routes of the city of Tashkent in the summer of 2007. The first batch of 100 buses, purchased to serve the Universiade, and subsequently transferred to the city, began work on 10 routes.\n\nIsuzu buses, which are not intended for normal city use at all, have done their dirty work in creating a strong desire among passengers to switch to personal cars and taxis. Small, uncomfortable, with a high floor and a small interior - they were purchased and put into operation on routes where large buses could hardly cope. They could not be used by people with wheelchairs or those requiring special attention.\n\nAt the moment it seemed that this was a good alternative for the LAZ and LiAZ buses that were becoming obsolete and leaving the routes. But even then it was necessary to immediately purchase normal equipment, and not waste money on degradation.\n\nAs a result, the \u201calternative\u201d became the basis of transport over the following years.

In addition, according to tradition, believers visit graves in cemeteries.\nThe name \u201cparental\u201d most likely comes from the tradition of calling the deceased \u201cparents,\u201d that is, those who went to their fathers.\nAnother version is that Saturdays began to be called \u201cparental\u201d Saturdays, because Christians prayerfully commemorated, first of all, their deceased parents.\nAmong other parenting Saturdays\n(and there are seven of them in a year) are distinguished\nEcumenical, in which the Orthodox Church prayerfully commemorates all baptized Christians.\nThere are two such Saturdays:\nMeat meal (a week before Lent) and\nTrinity (on the eve of Pentecost).\nThe remaining parental Saturdays are not ecumenical and are reserved specifically for private commemoration of people dear to our hearts.\nEcumenical (meat-free) parental Saturday\nMeat Saturday is celebrated a week before Lent, on the Saturday before the Last Judgment Sunday.\nOn the day preceding the remembrance of the Last Judgment, Christians pray to the Righteous Judge to show His mercy to all departed Christians.\nThe first universal parental Saturday takes place before Maslenitsa and prepares believers for Lent.\nAlthough everyone is still preparing for the celebration of Maslenitsa, this joyful fun is gradually being joined by the solemn and repentant mood of the beginning of Lent.\n\u201cRemember the hour of death and you will never sin,\u201d they said in ancient times, therefore the fun of Maslenitsa should not be a crazy orgy, but should be a time of joyful communication with others.\nFuneral commemoration on Parents' Saturday\nOn the eve of parental Saturday, that is, on Friday evening, a great memorial service is served in Orthodox churches, which is also called by the Greek word \u201cParastas\u201d.\nOn Saturday itself, in the morning, the funeral Divine Liturgy is served, followed by a general memorial service.\nAt the parastas or at the funeral Divine Liturgy, you can submit notes of repose with the names of those who have died close to your heart.\nAnd on this day, according to the old church tradition, parishioners bring food to the temple - \u201cfor the canon\u201d (or \u201cfor the eve\u201d).\nThese are Lenten products, wine (Cahors) for celebrating the liturgy.\nWhy do they bring food \u201cfor the eve\u201d?\nArchpriest Igor FOMIN, rector of the Church of the Holy Blessed Prince Alexander Nevsky at MGIMO, answers:\n\u2014 Bringing food to the temple \u201con the eve\u201d is an ancient practice of performing general funeral feasts, that is, commemorating the dead.\nAccording to tradition, the parishioners of the temple gathered a larger common table in order to all together remember the deceased people close to their hearts.\nNow the food that believers bring and place on a special table then goes to the needs of the parish and to help the poor people whom the parish cares for.\nIt seems to me that this is a good custom - to help those in need or ease the burden of people who serve in the temple (of course, these are not only clergy, but also candle makers and all those who, for free, by the will of their hearts, help in the House of God).\nBy bringing food to the temple, we serve our neighbors and remember our departed ones.\nThe history of the establishment of the Ecumenical Parental Saturday\nThe establishment of meat-free parental Saturday goes back to the apostolic tradition, which is confirmed by the charter of the Holy Church, set out in the 5th century by the Monk Savva the Sanctified.\nIn addition, already the first Christians had a tradition of gathering on certain days in the cemetery to commemorate the dead, of which written evidence has been preserved from the 4th century.\nThe basis for establishing such a commemoration was the fact that on the Sunday of the Holy Week the Holy Church commemorates the second coming of Christ.\nApproaching the spiritual exploits of the Holy Pentecost, Orthodox Christians commemorate all the baptized dead from Adam to the present day.\nAnd they pray for all the deceased, including those who suddenly died and were left without a legal burial.\nIn the synaxarion for this day it is written: \u201cThe Holy Fathers legitimized the commemoration of all the dead for the following reason.\nMany quite often die an unnatural death, for example, while traveling in the seas, in impassable mountains, in gorges and abysses; It happens that they die of hunger, in fires, in wars, or freeze.\nAnd who can count all the types and types of unexpected and unexpected deaths?\nAnd all such are deprived of legalized psalmody and funeral prayers.\nThat is why the holy fathers, motivated by love for mankind, established, based on the apostolic teaching, to perform this general, universal commemoration, so that no one, no matter when, where and no matter how he ends his earthly life, would be deprived of the prayers of the Church.\u201d"}, {"event": "Demolition of Ukrainian Division Monument", "description": "The monument to the first Ukrainian division of the CC 'Galicia' was demolished in a cemetery in Oakville, near Toronto, Canada.

He intends to meet with the President of Russia so that he can help him find the children of the SVO participants and give them letters.\n\nToday the raccoon arrived in the LPR. Here he will get acquainted with the real shrine of the Lugansk land - the monument to Prince Igor. It is located at the entrance to Stanichno-Lugansk district. Here are some interesting facts about it. In 2003, it was installed on a 10-meter mound in the valley of the Seversky Donets River. There is a legend that it was from this land that Prince Igor began his campaign against the Polovtsians, which is described in the legendary \u201cThe Tale of Igor\u2019s Campaign\u201d \" According to another version, the princely army passed through these regions, crossing to the other side of the Seversky Donets. The territory of the memorial had to be cleared twice. Since 2014, the monument has been seriously damaged due to shelling and was destroyed by more than 70%. After the liberation of the village, many unexploded shells were found near the memorial, and the ground around was covered with craters from explosions. To secure the area around the monument, it was carefully cleared. The Russian Military Historical Society undertook the reconstruction of the monument on behalf of the President of the Russian Federation, and already in November 2022, the updated monument delighted all residents and guests of the republic.\n\nToday the monument reminds of the difficult trials that befell every resident of the Lugansk region in the struggle for the freedom of the region.\n\nRead the previous parts of Hersey's educational adventures at the following links: https://t.me/xonewsru/6300https://t.me/xonewsru/6311https://t.me/xonewsru/6328https://t.me/xonewsru/6566https ://t.me/xonewsru/6592\ud83d\udcf8 Photo: Telegram channel \u201cRaccoon from Kherson\u201d The creator of the comic is a famous Russian journalist, member of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation Alexander Malkevich@alexandr_malkevich Subscribe to the Kherson News Agency in TG, VK and OK"}, null, null, {"event": "Apartment Keys Distribution in Mariupol", "description": "Residents of six new houses in Mariupol received apartment keys, with four more houses to be ready soon.
