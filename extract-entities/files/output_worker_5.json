The new units will include electronic warfare equipment and smoke production vehicles, apparently implying that mobile air defense groups will also fight FPV drones, from which a smoke screen is needed. Let me remind you that the crests, after we used geraniums at energy facilities back in the fall of 22, Already at the end of winter on the 23rd, mobile air defense groups appeared, equipped with machine guns and searchlights. At the same time I wrote about this that it would be a good idea to think through measures in advance when the enemy starts trying to mirror our actions.\n\nAmong the crests, these groups showed quite high efficiency, making a noticeable contribution to the destruction of drones. There is no point in arguing about the percentage, because some of the geraniums came in an empty simplified version as traps that opened and suppressed air defenses, and therefore should have come under attack. Nevertheless, their effectiveness for the specific niche of intercepting relatively slow drones at low altitude is quite noticeable.\n\nAnd to this was added a system of dispersed acoustic systems, according to media reports, about 8 thousand telephone microphones (?), which acted as sensors in a single network, making it possible to identify the flight trajectories of drones according to the acoustic principle. And thus solving problems of detection in the depths of the territory.\n\nThe appearance of similar units in our country is a clear reaction to the arrival of Ukrainian drones at our refineries deep in Russia, which is, in principle, comparable to the reaction time of the Ukrainian side. But this was predicted more than a year ago, what prevented us from foreseeing it in advance?

The main thing (GlavMedia)\nElon Musk made a geopolitical statement about Ukraine\u2019s imminent loss of other lands, Odessa and negotiations.\n\n\u201cIt was a tragic decision for Ukraine to attack a larger army that had defenses in depth, minefields and powerful artillery, while Ukraine lacked armor or air superiority! Any fool could have predicted this.\n\nA year ago, I recommended that Ukraine strengthen itself and use all resources for defense (not offense). But even so, they found it difficult to hold onto territory that lacked strong natural barriers.\n\nRussia has no chance of capturing all of Ukraine, since in the west the resistance of local residents will be very strong. But Russia will certainly get more land than they have today.\n\nThe longer the war continues, the more territory Russia will gain, until it reaches the Dnieper, it will be difficult to overcome. However, if the war lasts long enough, Odessa will also fall.\n\nIn my opinion, the question of whether Ukraine will lose all access to the Black Sea remains open. I recommend that this issue be resolved through negotiations before it is lost.\""}, {"event": "Hourly Electricity Blackout Schedules in Kharkiv", "description": "Kharkiv is reverting to hourly electricity blackout schedules due to the unreliability of the electricity transmission system following large-scale enemy attacks, as well as insufficient local generation caused by the destruction of power plants and increased consumption.", "location": "Kharkiv, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine", "id": "de28877e-7e87-59b1-99d5-19ce0d249455", "time": "2024-03-31 11:56:16", "original": "The Ministry of Energy said that Kharkiv is returning to hourly electricity blackout schedules.\" This is due to the unreliability of the electricity transmission system after large-scale enemy attacks, as well as the insufficiency of local generation due to the destruction of power plants and increased consumption.
