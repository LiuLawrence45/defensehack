New realities, extremely maneuverable warfare and rapid changes of positions, attack UAVs make such vehicles mandatory. And the same mortar crew has much less chance of getting surprises, having a banal loaf of bread on hand to transport the crew, guns, shells and quickly change positions (and a 60-mm mortar can fire directly from the vehicle, with proper skill ).\n\nUnfortunately, in the absence of special vehicles, we have to use civilian UAZs, Nivas, and just passenger cars.
