The head of Rostec, Sergei Chemezov, admitted that the supply of MS-21 could move even further.\n\nRostec controls the entire MS-21 production process. In addition to UAC, the state holding includes the aircraft engine manufacturer UEC, as well as suppliers of aircraft subsystems.\n\nThe first two production SJ-100s were to be certified and delivered to the launch customer, the Aeroflot group, in 2023, and the first six MS-21s by the end of 2024.\n\nIn the fall of 2023, Aeroflot entered into an agreement with the Aviacapital-Service company for the financial leasing of 18 MC-21-310 and 34 SJ-100. It is part of the group's huge framework order for 89 SJ-100s and 210 MC-21s.\n\nThe UAC explained the delay in the development of import-independent aircraft due to the difficulties faced by suppliers. They need to design completely new systems, recreate the necessary competencies from scratch, conduct full tests and launch mass production in a short time.\n\nThe first flight of the SJ-100 powered by Russian PD-8 engines was expected last year, but development of the power plant was delayed.\n\nThe MS-21 with Russian PD-14 engines was certified at the end of 2022, but many imported main systems need to be replaced on this model.\n\nThe first flight of the partially imported version of the MS-21, expected in November 2023, did not take place.\n\nRostec explained that the final appearance of the completely import-substituted aircraft will be formed only in the second half of this year.

Then these shots were picked up by Russian resources, but for some reason no one paid attention to the interesting points\nShow more\n1. An ATGM shell is a fairly powerful weapon and when it hits a target it explodes not only forming a cumulative jet, but spreading explosive energy in all directions. As a result, gases are formed that have a high temperature (from 1.5 to 3 thousand degrees). Thus, a spot with opalines should form around the site of impact, and in the photo even the paint is not burnt (Fig. 1)\n2. In Fig. 2 the probable direction of flight of the projectile is indicated; accordingly, the explosive force should have torn out sheets of metal (indicated by red curved arrows). The shell casings should also have been scattered by the blast wave. And again there are no scorches...\n3. In Fig. 3, the metal is characteristically dented inward, clearly not from being hit by a shell, but from fragments. Everything here is visible to the naked eye.\n4. Holes from fragments are clearly visible on the body, some of them quite large.\nConclusion: we dare to assume that this Bradley armored personnel carrier was not attacked by an ATGM, and the detonation of the active protection was caused by large hot fragments, for example from artillery shells.\nThus, Ukrainian propagandists are once again trying to deceive everyone around them, talking about the high merits of Western technology and deliberately underestimating the effectiveness of Russian weapons.\nWe do not pretend to be the ultimate truth, just an opinion, write your thoughts in the comments\nANTISEPTIC (https://t.me/antiseptic_channel)"}, {"event": "Shelling of Gorlovka", "description": "Gorlovka was shelled from 00:00 03/02/2024 to 00:00 03/03/2024.", "location": "Horlivka, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine", "id": "e3310663-2041-5682-bc03-2cb358f7b13c", "time": "2024-03-03 05:31:17", "original": "\u26a1\ufe0fInformation on shelling of Gorlovka from 00:00 03/02/2024 to 00:00 03/03/2024"}, null, {"event": "Russian Exterminators Clear House of Parasites", "description": "Russian soldiers detected an enemy assault group hiding in a house.

I will not hide that I have walked along this border more than once, but in this particular case, the reproach is inappropriate.\n\nI'll start with general things.\nAll radical movements of Central and Western Africa are largely implicated in a mixture of separatism, national exclusivity (linked, among other things, to the special tribal structure of individual ethnic groups that continues to this day), and, of course, radical Islam.\n\nIn general, how did many jihadist groups appear?

A little later they moved on to protecting various handicraft industries (gold and diamond mining) in locations adjacent to zones of seasonal livestock grazing, also including in its criminal specification the transit of radical ideas, weapons and drugs.\n\nThere is a common belief that this problem is one of the legacies of the colonial past. Indeed, one cannot help but see attempts by a number of Western states to use long-standing contradictions between ethnic groups and accompanying ways of life in Africa for their own selfish interests. But the problem goes even deeper. Interethnic conflicts occurred even before the arrival of Europeans on the Dark Continent. These problems are hundreds of years old.\nSome peoples, for example, have traditionally been engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing, others in trade and singing, others in cattle breeding, and some ethnic groups practiced slavery and slave trade.\u2757\ufe0fBecause of left-liberal attitudes, we cannot remain silent about the fact that due to mental differences ,certain ethnic groups are more susceptible to easy money and the propaganda of radical ideas. That a significant part of the jihadist groups in Africa have a distinct ethnic character, etc. And while we have the opportunity to freely communicate in the telegram space, I think it makes sense to continue a frank discussion, and not shut each other up.\nAt least in order to understand why our guys are dying for the sake of what and for whom on the Dark Continent. #sahel #russians_in_africa"}, {"event": "Meeting with Wagner PMC Fighters", "description": "Students at Arkhangelsk University, NArFU, met with fighters from the Wagner PMC who had returned from the combat zone in Ukraine.", "location": "Arkhangelsk, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia", "id": "ed378e62-dd35-5fbf-bdcf-decadbfa7dd3", "time": "2024-03-03 11:49:48", "original": "\u201cYou need to know a hero by sight\u201d At Arkhangelsk University, NArFU hosted students with fighters from the Wagner PMC, who returned from the combat zone in Ukraine.wagner_story"}, null, {"event": "Meeting of World Youth Festival Participants and Northern Military District Soldiers", "description": "Participants of the World Youth Festival met with soldiers of the Northern Military District in Sirius.

WITHOUT CREDITS\nYes, we look, Vadim Frantsevich, with the most wide-open eyes in surprise. Almost like in a movie with Tom Cruise. And we are almost as surprised. Because the demons are doing almost the same thing to our history as the partygoers in that same movie.\n\nHow is it that the demons, who were actively shaking our state in 2020, today brazenly and cynically continue the activity of installing monuments in Belarus to the faithful servants of the Polish kings that was interrupted for a year or two? I\u2019m talking about the sculptor Vladimir Pipin, Vadim Frantsevich. This figure, who distinguished himself in the Zmagar actions of 2020, back in 2019, as part of an organized group of people, erected a monument to Sapieha in Slonim. Presumably, without consultation with the Republican Council on Historical Policy, which simply did not exist at that time. But agents of foreign states were actively preparing for the Maydown of 2020 and spreading the metastasis of Rzhaczpospolitov\u2019s influence in the territory of Kresuv sprouts.\n\nAccording to BelTA, only in my native Grodno region it was planned to install a whole bunch of idols of various gentry:\u2757\ufe0f\"Monuments to other famous personalities will appear. In particular, in Slonim they are soon planning to install a bust of Mikhail Kazimir Oginsky. In Zhirovichi in 2020 they intend to erect a monument to Archimandrite Seraphim Zhirovichsky.\n\nNew monuments will appear in other areas of the region. In Lida, for example, the Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas was immortalized in bronze. An equestrian statue about 3 m high is installed on the site in front of Lida Castle. The grand opening of the sculpture will take place on City Day, which Lida will celebrate on September 7.\n\nIn addition, the issue of installing a monument to Prince Mindovg is being considered in Novogrudok. In Dyatlovo they plan to install a sculpture of the city\u2019s founder, Hetman Konstantin Ostrozhsky,\u201d the cultural department of GroIK told reporters.\n\nIt would be appropriate here to remember the words of our President Alexander Grigoryevich Lukashenko, for whom we voted in 2020 and support with all our hearts.\" Why be surprised if there were more portraits of Lithuanian and Polish nobility throughout the country than, for example, heroes of the Great Patriotic War or our modern history,\u201d said the President. \u201cWe saw the fruits of such \u201cpatriotic\u201d education in 2020.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s call it that in history textbooks, in castle and museum exhibitions, for example, the period of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth - the occupation of the Belarusian land by the Poles. Ethnocide of the Belarusians. What was this for our ancestors? - the Head of State asked a rhetorical question. - Native language, culture , faith is prohibited. Tycoons exchanged Belarusian peasants for dogs. But the people survived and preserved their identity.\" These words were spoken by the leader of the Belarusian people on January 6, 2022, just at a meeting on historical policy, at which you, Vadim Frantsevich, were also present. Must remember.\n\nBut even if an organized group of people had not stirred up, as evil tongues slander, their murky schemes with competitions, when the elderly People\u2019s Artist of Belarus Misko, who is over 90 years old, comes to an agreement with the executive committee, and Pipin and Logvin are creating, then even then questions would have arisen for \"fruits\" of Pepin's creative efforts. One of his \u201cmermaids\u201d in the Severny Bereg park in Minsk is worth something. I am sure that after looking at this gorgon, more than one child went straight to a psychologist to treat the consequences of psychological violence carried out in a particularly cynical form.\n\nThis is our view of history, Vadim Frantsevich. With your eyes wide open, just like you wanted.\nNo squinting: only surprise at the improbability of the events of modern Belarus...\n\nAnd deciding who to immortalize is, of course, the prerogative of the commission on historical policy, yes. @bondareva_bez_kupjurTelegramBondareva.

I believe that Kuleba\u2019s threats are connected with the desire of Washington or London to put pressure on other countries so that the latter supply Ukraine with air defense systems,\u201d the expert emphasizes.
