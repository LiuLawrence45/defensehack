As a result, the flying strike or reconnaissance UAV changes its flight path;\n- the system is capable of influencing the satellite navigation of missiles along the path of its flight - the point is that the missile guidance system accumulates errors, and at the final stage of the route it misses;\n- the error in aiming ranges from 1 to 10% of the missile\u2019s flight range. For example, if a missile flew 1000 km, then 1% is a 10 km error. Based on this information alone, we can conclude that the Pokrov system is theoretically capable of blocking or deceiving a cruise missile, turning it from a precision weapon into an ordinary blank with explosives (also same with attack UAVs). But the Ukrainian side is not interested in where they will fall further in the field or residential development - so to speak, there will be another reason to blame Russia and beg for money/weapons from the West, distorting reality.

It is known that no more than 8 units of such a system have been adopted and used by the enemy in various cities of Ukraine. The extent of damage to the installation is unknown, except that at the moment it is unable to function.\u25aa\ufe0fIn addition, it became known that it is in this area that the electronic warfare/RERD company of the Nepropetrovsk air brigade operates.\ud83d\udd0dWhat we managed to learn about the electronic warfare \"Pokrova\" based on information from open sources: - its work is based on the \u201cspoofing\u201d method - when the signal is not jammed, but changed. As a result, the flying strike or reconnaissance UAV changes its flight path;\n- the system is capable of influencing the satellite navigation of missiles along the path of its flight - the point is that the missile guidance system accumulates errors, and at the final stage of the route it misses;\n- the error in aiming ranges from 1 to 10% of the missile\u2019s flight range. For example, if a missile flew 1000 km, then 1% is a 10 km error. Based on this information alone, we can conclude that the Pokrov system is theoretically capable of blocking or deceiving a cruise missile, turning it from a precision weapon into an ordinary blank with explosives (also same with attack UAVs). But the Ukrainian side is not interested in where they will fall further in the field or residential development - so to speak, there will be another reason to blame Russia and beg for money/weapons from the West, distorting reality.\n\n\"Partian!\""}, null, null, {"event": "Establishment of Orders of Ushakov and Nakhimov", "description": "On March 3, 1944, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued a decree establishing the Orders of Ushakov and Nakhimov, I and II degrees, and medals to award officers and sailors of the Soviet Navy for their bravery and leadership during World War II.", "location": "Moscow, Russia", "id": "c38c0943-fef3-5053-bd3f-160f2ca04872", "time": "2024-03-03 09:45:17", "original": "On March 3, 1944, a Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR was issued on the establishment of the Orders of Ushakov and Nakhimov, I and II degrees, and medals.

It has a fragile body, makeshift hatches, and an aluminum engine compartment. The production quality is poor, even for a disposable product. The boat uses a Chinese jet ski engine, and its communication system includes two Starlink antennas, a Kymeta satellite antenna, and a dual-SIM cellular router.", "location": "Ukraine", "id": "ce1b8814-a214-5a33-8a88-3b43019bfc7b", "time": "2024-03-03 06:48:35", "original": "Forwarded from: UAV Developer\n1/2Today we are reviewing the crown of Ukrainian shipbuilding, the unmanned boat Magura, named after the former bus driver, and now the President of Venezuela, Maduro.\nMagura is a very thin and flimsy mold of a boat, reinforced with boards from a nearby construction site and parts from a grandmother\u2019s closet. The body is so fragile that it can be penetrated by firewood. Therefore, dead magura on the shore is not uncommon.\nThe hatches are made from barrel lids. The engine compartment (MTO) is aluminum, integrated into the boat using construction nanofoam.\nThe production is quite obscene, even for a disposable product.\nBetween the MTO and the outer top cover there is a space that is blown through by two bags. There are boxes with equipment there. This solution simultaneously cleans the engine from fuel vapors and reduces the thermal heating of the boat cover = thermal visibility.\nInside the engine compartment there is an almost unchanged Chinese jet ski. It is so unchanged that its instrument panel is fixed with glue inside the boat's hull and is viewed by a webcam (in the photo the instrument panel has already fallen off).\nThe system for adjusting this telemetry by bending the plate through a specially trained slot is especially delightful.\nMagura communicates with the outside world using two Starlink antennas, as well as a satellite communication antenna from Kymeta. This set of communications tells us that not everything is going smoothly with Starlinks. Either they are banned, or they themselves die in the sea, but inside there are actually two full-fledged parallel communication channels implemented, + kUmeta.\nAnother communication channel is the industrial dual-SIM cellular router RUT956. In the coastal zone (up to 40 km from the tower), it can cling to terrestrial mobile Internet.\nWe assumed earlier that one of the modes of operation of sea drones is to approach the shore directly using GPS, pick up the mobile network there and then aim at the target in hand. The router has GPS, but its antenna input is not connected, but both mobile antenna inputs are connected for both SIM cards and there is a connection trace on the LAN2 connector. This means the router is still in use."}, {"event": "Humanitarian Aid Drop", "description": "The Americans dropped humanitarian aid, including food rations, for the Palestinians, but unfortunately, the cargo fell into the sea, increasing the risk of loss.", "location": "Gaza Strip, Palestine", "id": "ce1ba32e-3326-57d1-9dc3-04d5632f7bf0", "time": "2024-03-03 18:38:37", "original": "The Americans dropped humanitarian aid for the Palestinians into the sea\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0fhttps://t.me/infantmilitario/120989TelegramMilitaristPalestinians are collecting food rations dropped by aircraft.
