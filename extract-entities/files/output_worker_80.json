Apparently, the board was converted for unmanned control and loaded with a small amount of explosives (or flew without any at all).\n\nThe flight range without modifications can be 1,100 kilometers, but if you remove some interior parts, it can be increased.\n\nThe idea of converting manned aircraft into unmanned ones is not new; similar projects exist in many countries around the world, and any \u201ccorn farmer\u201d can become a kamikaze drone.\n\nSoviet An-2s, for example, were used by Azerbaijan as a means of detecting Armenian air defenses during the war for Nagorno-Karabakh. For takeoff and takeoff, such an aircraft requires 100-150 meters, so there is no need to use an airfield for takeoff. In addition, there are many such aircraft - in 2021, the manufacturer reported the production of thousands of such aircraft. In addition to Ukraine, the A-22 is assembled on the territory of AEROPRAKT Polska Sp.z o.o in Zaklichin (Poland).\n\nA separate question is how the plane managed to overcome 1200 kilometers to Tatarstan. Most likely, there was no talk about a direct flight. In this case, the probability of losing the car would be high. Most likely, the flight took place at an extremely low altitude, bypassing air defense zones (who and how provided data on positional areas is another question that will need to be answered).\n\nAnother question that requires clarification is why the facility where the Geran-2 UAVs are assembled (the plane did not reach it by several hundred meters) was not reliably covered by air defense and protected from attacks by low-altitude drones.\n\nInformation about routes around air defense zones could be provided by US optical-electronic and electronic reconnaissance satellites. The sensors installed on them are capable of determining the positions and types of air defense systems by their visual portraits and the radiation parameters of their radars. @MChroniclesBot - send your photos and videos from the front.

Head of Yakutia Aisen Nikolaev held a meeting with the developers of the master plan for the supporting Arctic agglomeration of federal significance \u201cTiksi-Naiba\u201d.\nLet\u2019s make a reservation right away that the development of a master plan by the Siberian Laboratory of Urbanism is still at the initial stage.\n\nHowever, in addition to the inevitable bureaucratic procedures, the company\u2019s specialists managed to visit Tiksi and Naibe to see the situation with their own eyes and establish contacts with local residents.\n\nThe southern coast of the Arctic Ocean is far from the most comfortable place on this planet.\nIn addition to the gruelingly long polar night, there are often severe snowstorms with wind speeds of up to 35 m/sec (on average 35 days a year), and in the short summer (2 months) the air temperature does not rise above +7.5 degrees.\n\nAnd yet, in these extremely harsh conditions, 4,878 people live in the territory of the future agglomeration, from infants to people over 70 years old.\nLife, frankly speaking, is very, very difficult. For example, the housing stock in the village of Tiksi is 65% worn out. And the average wear and tear of engineering infrastructure is 70%.\n\nThe situation in Naibe is even worse. The entire housing stock here is actually in a state of disrepair and is not subject to major repairs. There is no water supply or sewerage.\nAnd also off-road. From Tiksi to Naiba can only be reached along a 135-kilometer winter road. Naturally, only in winter and only after severe frosts hit.\nAnd many other big and small problems.\n\nIt would seem that since everything is so bad, then we need to run away from these homeless places without looking back.\nBut! 65% of Tiksi residents surveyed said that they like living in this unkind land. And in Naibe there are as many as 97% of them!\n\nThe results of a survey about the problems of future agglomeration that require priority solutions are also very interesting.\nNaturally, dilapidated housing and deterioration of engineering systems came first.\n\nThe second stage involves cleaning up accumulated waste. There really is a huge problem with this case. Abandoned, gradually collapsing houses and industrial buildings, half-submerged ships rotting in the water, heaps of scrap metal of unknown origin, etc. They just create a depressing impression.\n\nBut in third place was the lack of stable Internet. The lack of modern infocommunications is felt by residents even more acutely than hard-to-reach and expensive logistics, which has moved to fourth place.\n\nWe are not yet ready to evaluate the work of the Siberian Laboratory of Urbanism. It's difficult to evaluate a master plan that doesn't exist yet.\nBut there was one moment (purely subjective) that I didn\u2019t like for sure. In our (un)biased opinion, the realization of the potential of future agglomeration is too extended in time.\nFor example, the modernization of the Tiksi seaport is planned for 2033, and the deep-water terminal in Naibe will appear only in 2034.\n\nFor comparison:\nGeological exploration and surveys are now being completed at the Kyuchus gold deposit (in the neighboring Ust-Yansky region), they plan to begin designing a mining and processing complex and begin to build infrastructure.\n\nIn the period 2025\u20132027, the White Gold company (a joint venture of Seligdar PJSC and RT-Business Development LLC) will construct the mining and processing plant with subsequent commissioning.\n\nAnd already in 2028, the mining and processing plant in Kyuchus should reach its design capacity to produce at least 10 tons of gold per year, no later than June 30 of the same year by connecting to electricity from the nuclear power plant in Ust-Kuiga in an amount of at least 35 MW.\n\nWhy the development of the Tiksi-Naiba agglomeration should lag behind its neighbors by as much as six years is not very clear.\nIt seems to us that the emergence of a deep-water sea terminal in Naibe should be somehow connected with the construction of a nuclear power plant and the development of Kyuchus.#Arctic#Yakutia#masterplanTelegram Aisen Nikolaev, Head of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia).

On April 2, 1996, the Treaty on the Formation of the Community of Russia and Belarus was signed, which became the starting point in strengthening relations and cooperation between the two countries. On the same day, the Supreme Council of the Community decided to establish the Day of Unity of the Peoples of Russia and Belarus!\n\nFor our fraternal peoples, this holiday is a very significant event, not only as a historical reminder of friendship and brotherhood, but also as a holiday that helps strengthen cultural, social and economic ties between our countries. A common history, a sense of mutual respect, trust and a desire to live in peace strengthen the alliance not only at the level of agreements between states, but also between people.\nDespite the difficult period that the international community is going through, our unity is only growing stronger. And only through joint efforts can we adequately respond to any challenges and threats.\n\nRussians and Belarusians are one people, and we are united! I wish us all peace, prosperity and success!\n\nFirst Deputy Chairman\nCommittee on CIS Affairs,\nEurasian integration\nand connections with compatriots.
