And the Swiss are cunning. They understand that they will spend 20-30 thousand Swiss francs per person per year, and paying 4 thousand is a cheap way to pay off. And it\u2019s not so simple: if you take this money, you need to sign documents that you will not return to Europe and will not demand it. You can come back under some other paragraph, for example, family reunion. But you will no longer demand social benefits. We multiply one or two million Ukrainians on the territory of the European Union by the annual allowance and add it to the military budget. And then it turns out that Switzerland and France separately are deceiving their people. Because when they say that 300 million will be allocated to Ukraine, this is not true: 300 million plus expenses for migrants, for refugees from Ukraine. And not all Ukrainians adapt, not all have learned German, French . It is easy to find the labor market in Poland, because it was black, but has become grey. In Europe, according to the law, they do not have the right to forcibly deport a person to a country in which there is a military conflict. They cannot expel a single Ukrainian from Europe. Expenses go even to those bureaucrats who appeared to process Ukrainian documents. I sincerely congratulate the Europeans.

The economy has benefited from exchange rate controls, past incentives, and the breach of sanctions, allowing corporations and households to maintain spending and avoid default.", "location": "Moscow, Russia", "id": "7dae5fdb-a87b-512c-a2bd-0dcb3e5b2b6f", "time": "2024-03-12 20:26:58", "original": "Forwarded from: Office Writes\nHere The Economist suffered about the stability of the Russian economy.\n\nThey say that the financial collapse, widely predicted in the spring of 2022, never happened. The Russian economy fell into recession, but it was less severe than expected and did not last long. The only hope was for inflation, which Putin himself was at one time concerned about, demanding that price increases be curbed.\n\nThe Russian economy seems to be once again proving that the pessimists are wrong, the publication bitterly states. Data due on March 13 is expected to show prices rose 0.6% month-on-month in February, up from 1.1% at the end of last year. Year-on-year inflation is likely no longer rising, reaching 7.5% in November.\n\nIt would seem that everything should lead to collapse. Total government spending increased by 8% in real terms. Demand for goods and services exceeded the economy's ability to supply them, forcing sellers to raise prices. Workers became especially difficult to find, not least because hundreds of thousands were conscripted into military service and tens of thousands fled the country. By October last year, nominal wages were growing at an annual rate of 18%, up from 11% at the start of the year. This has driven up prices for labor-intensive services such as healthcare and hospitality.\n\nBut alas, the Russian Ministry of Finance ruined everything. Last year he introduced exchange rate controls that force exporters to bring foreign currency into the Russian financial system. This was likely to support the ruble, which has strengthened in recent months, pushing down import prices.\n\nRussia is still heading for a \u201csoft landing,\u201d in which inflation slows without destroying the economy. The state of the economy is now consistent with the trend observed before the CBO; GDP grew by more than 3% in real terms last year. Unemployment remains at record lows. And there is little evidence of corporate problems; indeed, the rate of business closures recently hit an eight-year low. The Moscow Exchange hopes to conduct more than 20 initial public offerings this year, up from nine last year. The latest \"real time\" economic activity data is quite reliable.\n\n\nTrying to find an explanation, the publication assures that Russia's economic stability is partly a consequence of past incentives. Corporations and households have accumulated large cash balances in recent years, allowing them to continue spending even in times of high inflation and avoid default in the face of high borrowing costs. As in other parts of the world, the fall in labor demand has mainly led to a reduction in unfilled vacancies rather than a decline in the number of people employed.\n\nThe breach of sanctions also gave a boost to the economy. Russian production facilities previously owned by Western companies have reopened under new management. At the beginning of the CBO, sanctions made it difficult for Russian firms to find raw materials, which led to production delays. However, companies have now created strong supply chains with \u201cfriendly\u201d countries. More than half of goods imports come from China, double what they were before the sting operation.\n\nAs new trade relationships developed, Russian exporters dared to raise prices, supporting revenues and profits. For example, the discount on oil that Russia offers to Chinese buyers has fallen from more than 10% at the beginning of 2022 to about 5% today.\n\nAnd what to do about it is still unclear. The stagnating economies of the European Union are no longer able to withstand their own sanctions, which, as is known, are imposed on their own in order to suppress the benefits of trade with \u201cnot their own\u201d. But, having sealed their own mouths, they left the lion's share of the world trade pie to Russia and its partners."}, null, null, {"event": "Occupation of Nevelskoye", "description": "Russian Armed Forces' assault units have taken up positions east of Nevelskoye settlement.", "location": "Nevelskoye, Bryansk Oblast, Russia", "id": "7db8beda-e157-5ea5-8387-4f0f22dac413", "time": "2024-03-12 11:22:48", "original": "Forwarded from: Z committee + SVO card\n\ud83c\udfd8#NevelskoyeAssault units of the Russian Armed Forces occupy positions east of the settlement of Nevelskoye.\ud83d\uddc4Video source\ud83d\uddfaMap\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffbSupport\ud83d\udce8Mail \"Z-committee\""}, {"event": "Control of Tetkine Village", "description": "The 'Freedom of Russia' Legion, led by Oleksiy Baranovskyi, claims control over the village of Tetkine in the Kursk Region.

Perhaps the most powerful impulses were observed in the territories that would later be united into Ukraine.\n\n5 days after the start of the revolution, mass rallies began at large enterprises in Kharkov.

The first meeting was attended by 78 people representing 43 organizations.

It all started with rallies at enterprises. Then the workers of the locomotive plant formed columns and marched to the city center with red banners. They were joined by workers from the Helferich-Sade plant, the General Electricity Company, soldiers and students.\n\nThe politicians, just released from prison, received the floor. The sources describe the fiery speech of the Bolshevik Efim Tinyakov (party pseudonym \u201cFedya Nekrasov\u201d), which was met with enormous support.\n\nOn March 5, a mass demonstration of Polish workers took place in Kharkov under the sign of unity with the Russian proletariat, and the movement of the Jewish Socialist Workers Party intensified. March 12 is declared a holiday of the revolution.\n\nOn March 20, the Council of Workers' Deputies merged with the Council of Soldiers' Deputies.
