Therefore, without weapons of mass destruction, they were only suitable for harassing attacks on cities. And the DPRK took one of the most interesting paths. There they decided to somehow update the large stocks of Hwasong-5 and Hwasong-6 missiles they had produced until a replacement was found.\n\nThe first option, back in the 1990-2000s, was the creation of a variety of cluster warheads equipped with various submunitions. This made it possible to make not very accurate old missiles, even without WMD warheads, quite effective at least against area targets such as airfields. New head parts just went to warehouses, and were installed in the same way before use. Without the need to make changes to the rocket itself.\n\nThe second option, already in the second half of the 2010s, was to equip the old Hwasong-5 missiles with a warhead with aerodynamic surfaces. This made it possible to control the final section and significantly increase accuracy. Here it was necessary to make changes both to the equipment and to the general design of already manufactured missiles. Fortunately, the flight characteristics of this missile (simple ballistic trajectory, relatively low speed) did not put forward any special requirements either for navigation equipment or for aerodynamic controls. And in the 2010s, the necessary equipment (navigation, computer, electrical) could already be purchased even on the public civilian market, albeit through third parties. This made the modernization very cost-effective and the missile became suitable for hitting small targets. Something like UMPC modernization for FAB, but only now for BR.\n\nThus, at a very modest cost, the military relevance of old missiles was maintained for decades.

Therefore, without weapons of mass destruction, they were only suitable for harassing attacks on cities. And the DPRK took one of the most interesting paths. There they decided to somehow update the large stocks of Hwasong-5 and Hwasong-6 missiles they had produced until a replacement was found.\n\nThe first option, back in the 1990-2000s, was the creation of a variety of cluster warheads equipped with various submunitions. This made it possible to make not very accurate old missiles, even without WMD warheads, quite effective at least against area targets such as airfields. New head parts just went to warehouses, and were installed in the same way before use. Without the need to make changes to the rocket itself.\n\nThe second option, already in the second half of the 2010s, was to equip the old Hwasong-5 missiles with a warhead with aerodynamic surfaces. This made it possible to control the final section and significantly increase accuracy. Here it was necessary to make changes both to the equipment and to the general design of already manufactured missiles. Fortunately, the flight characteristics of this missile (simple ballistic trajectory, relatively low speed) did not put forward any special requirements either for navigation equipment or for aerodynamic controls. And in the 2010s, the necessary equipment (navigation, computer, electrical) could already be purchased even on the public civilian market, albeit through third parties. This made the modernization very cost-effective and the missile became suitable for hitting small targets. Something like UMPC modernization for FAB, but only now for BR.\n\nThus, at a very modest cost, the military relevance of old missiles was maintained for decades.

Thus, the authorities plan to bring the infrastructure and appearance of mahallas to a single standard and create a transparent monitoring system.\n\nOne of the innovations is the introduction of a KPI system (performance indicators) to attract employees such as the person on the street, house, or entrance, as well as motivate employees who organize their work most efficiently.\n\nPerhaps these measures will optimize costs for self-government bodies. As analysts note, in Uzbekistan for three years in a row, expenses for the maintenance of government agencies, courts and mahallas have increased.\n\nIn 2022, the President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev announced an administrative reform to reduce government agencies and optimize their expenses - then departments, judicial bodies and mahallas cost the state $1 billion. But the authorities were unable to contain the growth of expenses, and in 2023 they already amounted to $1.3 billion.\n\nIn the future, these expenses will most likely continue to grow, analysts say.

On the way to independence, Georgia went through many upheavals. Civil war, loss of territory and Russian military aggression.\n\nBut one of the most tragic dates in the modern history of the state was April 9, 1989, when Soviet troops dispersed a peaceful demonstration in the center of Tbilisi. Reasons for the demonstration A month before the tragic events, a national gathering of the Abkhaz people took place in the village of Likhny demanding secession from the Georgian SSR and joining RSFSR. In Tbilisi they believed that the gathering was provoked by Moscow. Thousands of opponents of the secession of Abkhazia began to gather under the Government House in the capital of Georgia.\n\nSoon, demonstrators in Tbilisi began calling for Georgian independence. The republican authorities did not enter into direct dialogue with them. But the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Patiashvili, turned to Moscow for military support. \u201cNight of the Sapper Blades\u201d At approximately 4 o\u2019clock in the morning on April 9, Soviet troops began an operation against the demonstrators. Moreover, it was planned in such a way that the displacement turned into encirclement and beating of the unarmed.\n\n900 military personnel of the internal troops and airborne units used batons, sapper blades and toxic substances against the demonstrators.\n\nAs a result of these actions, 21 people died (16 of them women), and another 427 people were injured. The organizers of the demonstration were arrested, and a curfew was introduced in the city. A turning point in the history of the country. The death of innocent, unarmed people, most of them women, shocked society so much that the idea of independence became unconditional and uncompromising.\n\nOn April 9, 1991, exactly two years after the tragic events, the Act of Restoring the Independence of the Country was adopted. Georgia became the 4th republic to formally secede from the USSR. This date became the day of remembrance of the victims and the day of national unity.\ud83d\udcf9BBC#analyticsSubscribe/Eng Twitter/YouTube/Eng Telegram"}, null, {"event": "Artillery Operation", "description": "The 123rd brigade of the 2AK deployed artillery against the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Belogorovka.", "location": "Belogorovka, Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine", "id": "4e41ebee-beba-55ae-bd27-901cc40398f7", "time": "2024-04-09 18:23:47", "original": "\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6The artillery of the 123rd brigade of the 2AK worked against the Armed Forces of Ukraine in BelogorovkaSubscribe to the channel"}, {"event": "Restoration of Bank Protection Structures", "description": "The Russian government allocated 5.1 billion rubles to restore 26 damaged bank protection structures in Crimea, including 22 in Yalta, 2 in Nikolaevka, and 2 in Alushta.
