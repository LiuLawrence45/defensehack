Of course, with an eye to the military development of the Arctic and counteraction to Russia. Since December last year, various pacifist movements have been holding conferences and seminars on the topic of involving quiet and calm Scandinavia in geopolitical showdowns.\n\nAnd lately, the theses that are voiced there have become more and more acute. Especially considering that the American presence will only expand.\n\nHere I have pulled out the most interesting, in my opinion, arguments that the Danes use when trying to ask their government about the possible risks of such an aggressive policy. Although this is reminiscent of a voice crying in the wilderness: Up to 36,000 American soldiers are stationed in Germany. At the same time, the German Government, especially in the last two years, has been destroying its economic potential, including depriving itself of access to cheap energy resources due to the abandonment of Nord Stream from Russia. The question is, does the presence of American troops in Germany help the German government make decisions that lead to such results? - writes Line Lauridsen from the organization Tid til Fred. An agreement with the United States would mean a serious violation of two main principles of Danish defense and security policy: the absence of foreign troops on Danish ground and the absence of nuclear weapons on Danish soil...The US has a policy of never publishing or answering questions about whether it stores nuclear weapons on its military bases. We encountered this, for example, in Greenland, where the United States did not report that it had nuclear weapons at the Thule base, says Tove Jensen, an activist from the Peace Initiative organization. /dkdox.tv/videos/DK24002[26:06]"}, null, {"event": "FPV Drone Arrival into Shoigu Golf Cart", "description": "An FPV drone landed on a Shoigu golf cart, specifically a Chinese Desertcross 1000-3 with deer.

Residents of Austin, Texas, are outraged by the shortage of police officers and increased response times to 911 calls after the city council voted to defund the department in 2020. One day in February\nparts of the city were left without a single police officer for several hours due to staff shortages.\n\nAustin Police Association President Michael Bullock said the steady decline in public safety has brought the city \"to the brink of disaster.\" Previous boards and leadership actively worked against our officers and department, which has now left us in a free-falling staffing crisis, Bullock warned. \u2014 <...> Every year since 2017, we have lost more officers than we hired. We had to gut our specialized units and force detectives to work patrol to try to answer 911 calls. Last year, the police department was on the verge of a personnel collapse when 40 officers resigned after the City Council voted to eliminate a four-year contract and introduce a one-year contract that was rejected by the police union board. The result, Bullock said, was that our state was set back 15 years while we faced population growth of more than 250,000 new residents. Add to that a district attorney who has made it very clear that his priority is prosecuting cops and freeing criminals, not public safety. In 2020, the City Council voted to cut the police department's budget by a third and reinvest the funds into other services. The city restored funding in 2021, but an officer shortage persists, leading to an exodus of police officers.\n\nAccording to Austin old-timers, \u201cthe days when you knew you'd get help when you called 911 are long gone.\u201d Subscribe to Telegram NIGHTINGALLES!"}, null, null, null, {"event": "Destruction of Abrams Tank", "description": "A video shows the destruction of an Abrams tank near Avdiivka by 'Ghoul' FPV drones.

Yes, indeed, the Abrams is one of the three heaviest tanks, with the Merkava Mk.4M in first place.\n\nAfter this tank began to be delivered to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, everyone wondered in which direction it might jump out. At that time, the hottest place was Zaporozhye, where the enemy lost large quantities of foreign equipment (M2 Bradley, Leopard 2, Challenger 2).\n \nSix months have passed. Videos began to appear again showing the direct operation of a tank on positions of the Russian Armed Forces from a closed firing position: standard tactics, shot - quick escape. A week later, it was discovered by ZALA scouts in the Avdeevsky direction, where it was soon destroyed by an FPV crew. GOAL. The enemy from the 47th Mechanized Infantry Brigade \"Magura\" decided to use this equipment to intimidate the troops of the Russian Armed Forces. But this is war, and here There is no invulnerable technology, as our guys proved using the example of the famous tank.\n \nWe assume that the enemy has an old version of the tank without Uranium Armor. Otherwise we would have had to tinker with him longer. This machine is heavy and slow due to its size. He performed well in the sand, but today there are different conditions, different soil and different rules of engagement. Here they will destroy you with a drone for 50,000 rubles, without looking at what the equipment is made of and where it was brought from, and even more so in such dimensions as the Abrams it will be difficult for our FPV operators to miss. HOW DID the M1 Abrams APPEAR ON THE BATTLE FIELD? Stocks of armored vehicles in the warehouses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are depleted every day. Post-Soviet modernized T-72s have been practically destroyed, and deeply modernized T-64s are not able to compete with modern weapons during battles.
