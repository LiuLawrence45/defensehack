Under each bas-relief there was a plaque with the name and years of life. Due to the fact that all the bas-reliefs in the lower tier did not fit (in a hurry, the stone tier was laid out half a meter shorter in length), the bas-relief of P.N. Krasnov. was not installed, but the sign was hung under the sculpture.\nWhat happens? Krasnov is not among the many bas-reliefs. But there is a plaque with his name under the monument.
