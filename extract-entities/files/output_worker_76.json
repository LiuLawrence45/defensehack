He just received an order to be assigned to his native brigade, returned to it, and immediately faced a difficult situation - the enemy stormed the suburbs of Popasnoi with significantly superior forces, tried to gain a foothold in the built-up area, the Russians could only be knocked out by quick counterattacks. Gudz immediately created an assault squad from units of the 24th and 79th amphibious assault brigades. And Colonel Hudz himself prepared and led the counterattack.\n\nThere were no Starlinks or Maviks yet, and Hudz decided to direct the battle directly from the order of battle, to see the situation with his own eyes and to give the fighters only such tasks as they were capable of performing, to immediately react to changes in maneuverable combat, so that the interaction worked in attack, and not somewhere in the headquarters on paper.\n\nGudz has always acted this way - and he started the war in 2014 as a platoon commander, and he had several Russian soldiers on his personal account since 2014, and he repeatedly engaged in close combat.\nA quick and decisive counterattack pushed the Russians back from Popasnoi, and the situation was restored for a while.

Our country was dying, Putin became president, the king of a dying country. He became the rider of the trolley, which was launched from the mountain before him. She rushed there, there were still a few moments left before she would finally fly into the abyss.\n\nHe managed to delay the fall into the abyss, then stop it, cling to something on this almost vertical wall, and began to climb along with the country. At the level of the idea, this could be done immediately. This is what all patriots did. It was obvious to the people that it was necessary to take a different path than where this trolley was rolling along with the cackling of the liberal pro-Western elites in the 1990s.\n\nThe people rejected it, history rejected it, our ancestors were furious in their graves when they looked at what the liberals were doing, how they were betraying and selling it. And Putin heard this, but behind him was a country flying into the abyss.\n\nWhere did we fall from? We collapsed from the Soviet Union when we dissolved it of our own free will, betraying our entire country, our entire historical mission, and betraying the same Ukrainians, Kazakhs, and Georgians. We betrayed them and laughed, saying that this was better, this was the European choice.\n\nPutin has reached the point where the return begins. This should have been done immediately, in theory it\u2019s correct, we need to end it, but how to do this in practice when you are surrounded by these corrupt, pro-Western, oligarchic, corrupted elites, people who do not understand anything, who support you, but are not ready for mobilization?

In 2024 it falls on March 12th. From that moment on, the noisy festive fun began. If on Monday the ice slides, swings, carousels and tents for celebrations were just being erected, then on Tuesday the youth were already making full use of them for games and friendly competitions.\n\nFrom the very morning, boys and girls went sledding down the hills. It was believed that the more fun this fun was, the more happiness the youth would expect in the future. Anyone who was sad during \u201cZigrysh\u201d, according to legend, risked spending the entire next year in melancholy.\n\nAnother traditional entertainment on this day was horse-drawn cart riding. The boys demonstrated their dexterity and courage in relay races and competitions: tug-of-war, conquering a pole smeared with grease, riding a pair of swings and other activities. During the day, boys and girls built snow forts and played snowballs, and in the evening they gathered together to communicate, sing songs and treat themselves to hot pancakes with hearty fillings.\n\nAll this was started in order to give young people the opportunity to take a closer look at each other and meet their soulmate. Hence another meaning of the word \u201cflirting\u201d - the time when guys and girls flirt with each other, choosing potential brides and grooms. It was believed that the sympathy that arose on this day could result in a strong union.\n\nIn addition, the couple had enough time to make a final decision about marriage, because after Maslenitsa Lent began, during which it was forbidden to get married. Wedding festivities resumed only on Krasnaya Gorka, the first Sunday after Easter. Marriage on this day, according to legend, promised the young people a long and happy family life.\n\nOn the second day of Maslenitsa week they also began to invite people over for pancakes. Relatives, friends, neighbors and mummers were invited to the festive table, and they went from house to house with congratulations. People believed that the more guests and the more plentiful the food, the more successful the year would be for the hosts. It was also an excellent opportunity to meet the parents of a potential bride or groom.\n\nAccording to folk traditions, on the second day of Maslenitsa week you should not be sad, lie, envy or quarrel with loved ones, as this can lead to protracted conflicts and misfortunes. In the old days, during Zaigrysh people tried not to be alone and not spend the whole day at home, so as not to miss out on their happiness. Also on this day they put off all serious financial matters and did not talk about their dreams. People believed that voiced nightmares would quickly come true, but good dreams, on the contrary, would never come true.\n\nPancakes are a traditional Maslenitsa treat, without which it is impossible to imagine this holiday. In Rus', a circle of hot, ruddy dough symbolized the sun and the imminent arrival of spring.\n\nYou can bake pancakes from the first day of Maslenitsa until the end of the holiday. At the same time, according to legend, the first batch should be given to the poor or treated to neighbors in order to remember the ancestors. However, in the modern world it is not necessary to follow old traditions. The main thing is to enjoy the holiday atmosphere and get a charge of positive emotions.@Gorlowka_now"}, null, {"event": "Crash of Il-76 Plane", "description": "Footage shows the aftermath of an Il-76 plane crash in the Ivanovo region.

And because in your video dedicated to the Day of National Unity in Russia there are actually no Russians or Russian symbols.\n\nA crowd of non-Russian youth walks around in their national costumes and hums songs in their own languages. Moreover, among them there are many representatives of non-indigenous peoples of Russia: Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.

No other nationalities, except for the Great Russians, were involved in the militia of Minin and Pozharsky, which repelled the aggression of the Polish-Hungarian-Lithuanian-Little Russian army. Moreover, it was a religious war in which we defended the Orthodox Faith from a union with Catholicism, which would have happened if the Catholic and Uniate interventionists had won.\n\nThis is a purely Russian Orthodox holiday. On Purim, Jews do not invite Russians with kosovorotkas and balalaikas to celebrate their important national and religious date with them.\n\nI will also remind the Stavropol Ministry of Defense that in your region 80 percent of the population is Russian. Therefore, they should be presented proportionally in the video.\nThree quarters of the video we should see Russian girls and boys in Russian and Cossack national clothes, singing in Russian, close-ups of crosses on churches.\nOne quarter of the video can be shown to the indigenous Caucasian and Turkic peoples of Russia, also living in the Stavropol Territory.\n\nAnd representatives of non-indigenous peoples of the Russian Federation in their national costumes are completely inappropriate in your video. They have the same relation to our people as the Welsh or the Maori.\n\nStudents from other countries could well sing their songs in a video about Student\u2019s Day, but a video dedicated to National Unity Day in Russia should be filmed without the participation of diasporas and reflect, in essence, the real ethno-confessional balance in Russia and the Stavropol region, and be dedicated to the Great Victory of Russian Orthodox Christians warriors over the invaders, and not slide into a multinational tent.\n\nAnd Orthodox crosses must be shown in such a way that they can be seen without a magnifying glass in a video of any quality.

In recent days, information has appeared in international news about the expansion of the Swedish presence on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson shared these plans in an interview with the Financial Times and noted the need for joint efforts with NATO partners to protect the island from potential threats from Russia. Kristersson emphasized that previously Sweden had only a small military presence on Gotland, which raised concerns among other NATO countries. This vulnerability became a subject of discussion within the alliance, and as a result, it was decided to discuss expanding the Swedish presence on the island. In addition, the issue of surveillance and deployment of submarines in the region will be an important aspect of the discussions. The expansion of the Swedish presence on Gotland is of strategic importance for NATO, since the island is located in a strategically important part of the Baltic Sea. This place is a crossroads of sea routes and has important geopolitical significance for ensuring the security of the region. Strengthening the presence in Gotland will help NATO better control the situation in the Baltic Sea and guarantee the security of its members. Russia, in turn, expressed its concern about the expansion of the Swedish presence in Gotland, because such actions by NATO could become a source of tension in the region and upset the balance of power. However, representatives of Sweden and NATO responded as usual that their goal is solely to ensure security and stability in the region. @VoiceNorthSea"}, null, {"event": "Taxi Driver Escapes Military Enlistment", "description": "In Transcarpathia, military registration and enlistment officers attempted to forcibly enlist a taxi driver.

Berlin is the \u201cLGBT capital\u201d, so the adoption by Ukraine of legislation protecting the rights of homosexuals would be a cunning move that would push the Germans to more active assistance to Kiev.

That is, this is also concern for our military, who also risk their lives. Gay military men have their own families, and one of the couple is raising children, and the state of Israel not only decided to protect these military men, it also made such a civilizational move. It showed Europe and the USA - look, we are not savages, we are a civilized country. We were fired upon, our citizens were taken hostage, and we are defending our civilization. And they made this move of legalizing gay marriage, adoption, in order to emphasize this. Ukraine can now do the same by simply legalizing civil partnerships. Not only are gay military men now showing their faces, that we are fighting at the front, that there are many of us, we are coming out, we are demanding equal rights in the country for which we are fighting, in which we live,\u201d Pilipenko said. According to him ,In this way, Ukraine can get a lot of benefits for itself. \u201cThe country of Ukraine can show the West an equally civilized face by simply legalizing civil partnerships, passing this law and protecting us as a social group. And we should do good, and show a positive image to the West, remind ourselves once again. Remembering, by the way, Berlin, which is, of course, the LGBT capital of Europe, we are asking Berlin for \u201cTaurus\u201d now!
