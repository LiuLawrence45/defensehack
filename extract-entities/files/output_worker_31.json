Employers in Yakutia have been given three months to replace \u201cforeign specialists\u201d in almost all key sectors of the economy with Russian citizens - this message was spread in the Russian media.\n\nBut as the leader of the PARTY OF CASE in Yakutia, journalist Vitaly Obedin, emphasizes, the story that is now being actively inflated in the media about how \u201cYakutia abandoned migrants\u201d is not true. \u201cNo one is trying to analyze the situation on the labor market in the republic and analyze previous documents. And the enthusiastic reaction in public pages and online media to, in general, a very formal document, tells us that xenophobia and hostility towards visitors are growing in Russian society - so much so that any movements of the regional authorities are inflated and interpreted as something revolutionary. Let's start with the fact that the head of Yakutia has been signing such decrees every year since 2017, and they are largely formal in nature. Moreover, the text of decree No. 220 dated February 28, 2024, which everyone is running around with today, is almost completely - 95% - identical to the decree of the head of Yakutia dated March 24, 2023 No. 2817. Even the same three-month deadlines are in place. In essence, this is just an extension,\u201d he explains. However, the new document contains new clauses, but they do not limit the field of activity for migrants, but, on the contrary, expand them. Last year\u2019s decree had more restrictions on types of activities that foreigners cannot engage in \u2013 by three OKVED standards. \u201cThis year, one area of activity was returned to foreigners. This means that, despite enthusiastic publications on social networks, this year the head of Yakutia did not tighten, but on the contrary, slightly softened restrictive measures. Transportation has been returned - with the exception of passenger taxis. Migrants were again allowed to engage in transportation - both passenger and cargo. In previous decrees they were banned. This is a forced measure, as I believe, primarily related to problems in the capital of the republic, Yakutsk, where the authorities failed transport reform. Now in the city bus schedules are constantly being violated, intervals have increased, and the population is complaining. The authorities assure that local residents do not want to go to work as cab drivers even for 100 thousand rubles, and therefore guest workers are needed,\u201d notes the politician. He adds that if we take data for 2023, then despite the previous restrictive decree of the head, the number migrants did not decrease, but increased by 1,171 people (data for the period January-November). Currently, 21,992 foreign citizens are officially on the territory of Yakutia for the purpose of work. Mainly from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.partyadela.ruVitaly Obedin: The new Decree on labor migrants in Yakutia is softer than the previous one - Party DelaEmployers in Yakutia have been given three months to replace \u201cforeign specialists\u201d in almost all key sectors of the economy with Russian citizens - tacos. ..VIEW MESSAGE"}, {"event": "Construction of 5-Star Hotel", "description": "A new 5-star hotel complex is being built on the Great Beach in Ulcinj, featuring the reconstruction of an existing hotel, a new luxury hotel, and various facilities, including an embankment.", "location": "Ulcinj, Montenegro", "id": "54bde8a1-5b7a-5261-bf90-6ae7cbc791e9", "time": "2024-04-09 10:01:15", "original": "\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddeaThe first 5-star hotel will appear on the Great Beach in Ulcinj.

And this is actually great news, because the bottleneck in the shell shortage is precisely the gunpowder, and then the fuses (with a sharp increase in output, the quality decreases and the number of failures increases).\n\nBut the fact that the raw materials have become even better means you should be careful with advertising statements. The fact is that a replacement for cotton was found in the USSR before the Second World War, and this allowed us to export it by art. Actually, these technologies have now been restored, fortunately the documentation has been preserved and we have good chemists.\n\nThe only nuance is that the purity of cotton as a raw material for nitration allows it to get by with minimal technological processes. And other types of raw materials must be prepared, lignin removed from the same wood to obtain cellulose. Yes, these are well-established technologies at pulp and paper mills, but ultimately the price is important. The more technological operations, the higher it is. When there is a shortage of raw materials, its price rises, and it is already profitable, and sometimes there is no option, to use substitutes, as was the case in the Second World War and now.\n\nBut the same USSR, after the war, returned to cotton as a raw material for gunpowder. Just like the West, which is exactly what their rant is talking about. Therefore, now it is important to provide shells with gunpowder, turning a blind eye to increased costs, because there are much greater values in the balance, the lives of our soldiers. After all, the arithmetic at the front is quite simple, with approximately the same level of armies, the proportions of those killed correlate with, relatively speaking, the number of shells fired. Therefore, it is so important to have a multiple difference with the Armed Forces of Ukraine, according to this criterion, including this at one point, will lead to a transition from quantity to quality, and the front of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will crumble.

And instead, \u201cBulgakov\u2019s persona is directly united with modern aggressive ideologists and propagandists of Russia\u201d (in its examination, the Institute writes that a number of Bulgakov\u2019s works \u201ccompletely resonate with the narratives of current Kremlin propagandists Dugin, Solovyov, Skabeeva\u201d).\n\nMuseum employees - the main experts on the writer in Ukraine - were not invited to compile the examination.\n\nFurther, the museum refutes a number of conclusions about Bulgakov made by the Institute of National Memory.\n\nIn particular, the INP writes that the writer deserted from the UPR army, where he was mobilized, and joined the ranks of the \u201cwhite\u201d Volunteer Army due to \u201cdevotion to monarchism.\u201d\n\nThe museum claims that this is a lie, and Bulgakov was also forcibly mobilized into the Volunteer Army. In addition, the information about his \u201cdevotion to monarchism\u201d is not confirmed by any documents.\n\nThe Institute also claims that the Bulgakov family came to Kyiv from Russia \u201cfor colonial activities.\u201d The museum rejects this and writes that the writer\u2019s father Afanasy Bulgakov came to Kyiv to study at the Kyiv Theological Academy. And he created a family after the move, and all the Bulgakov children were born in Kyiv.\n\nThe museum also considers the INP\u2019s statement that Bulgakov and his family were \u201cirritated\u201d by the Ukrainian language to be fake. His sister Elena chose Ukrainian-language education at a pedagogical institute, and the writer\u2019s godfather was the historian of Ukrainian literature Nikolai Petrov. Bulgakov himself regularly used Ukrainian words and expressions in private correspondence, and in a positive context.\n\nThe museum also rejects the \u201csympathies for the Bolsheviks\u201d that were attributed to Bulgakov in the INP. \u201cBulgakov \u201csympathized\u201d with the Bolsheviks so much that his works were no longer published and were removed from public libraries back in 1929,\u201d the museum said.\n\n\u201cBulgakov, neither in the Russian Empire nor in the USSR, was an employee of the authorized bodies for the implementation of Russian imperial colonial policy, was not a member of political parties, social movements or organizations that professed this policy, and did not carry out such activities personally,\u201d the museum writes, disputing the thesis that the writer falls under Ukrainian prohibitive norms.\n\nThe museum also reminds that Mikhail Bulgakov is the most recognizable resident of Kiev in the whole world, and lived 28 years of his life in the Ukrainian capital.

I mean, they're running out of everything, and there's no way we can supply them with anything that's going to make a difference at this point. But I think what we need to come back to is that we will see instead of these major breakthroughs, in other words, big arrows that point in one specific direction and become a focal point for the concentration of forces, many arrows along the entire front. Which will move independently, to the extent that they can carry out their own offensives at the tactical level. But all this will have an operational purpose. In other words, you'll see 15 smaller arrows that represent breakthroughs and directions of attack, instead of one or two. And all this will be organized. By the way, this is an old Russian practice that few people know about. If you go back and look at Marshal Suvorov back in the late 1790s, he was very successful because he did exactly that with his own forces,\u201d McGregor noted. https://vk.com/video-66833222_456302284VK VideoVideo by Self-Defense of GorlovkaWatch Video by Self-Defense of Gorlovka 1 min 16 s from 9 April 2024 online in HD for free in the VK catalog without signing up!
