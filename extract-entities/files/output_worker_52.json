The Russian Ministry of Defense will pay the Zvezdochka Ship Repair Center 1.101 billion rubles, which the company invested in the repair and modernization of the nuclear deep-sea station of the Sperm Whale series.\n\nThe contract for the modernization of the underwater station was signed back in 2005. During this time, the Zvyozdochka shipbuilding center (part of the United Shipbuilding Corporation, USC) spent about 11 billion rubles on repairs and modernization of the station, and the Ministry of Defense transferred only 9.9 billion rubles to the enterprise. The Moscow Arbitration Court considered that Zvezdochka should receive the remaining amount from the customer. The decision was made on March 29.\n\n\u201cZvezdochka\u201d carried out the work at project 19100, serial number 402B, the case file says. Judging by the data from the RussianShips.info directory, we are talking about Soviet nuclear deep-sea stations of the Sperm Whale project. The serial number 402 corresponds to the AS-15 station, which became part of the fleet in 1991.\n\nDetails about what exactly the modernization should have been are not given in the text of the court decision; it is only indicated that Zvezdochka was tasked with installing and testing various samples of systems and complexes.\n\nInitially, it was assumed that Zvezdochka would complete the modernization by 2010, then the deadline was moved to December 31, 2016.\n\nApparently, the chances of completing everything on time were initially high - in the summer of 2015, Zvezdochka entered the stage of mooring tests. Acceptance tests would then be completed and the project would be completed. However, the mooring tests could not be completed - the pressure glands at the facility failed (they are used to protect the cable entry point).\n\nAs a result, it was decided to replace the pressure seals throughout the entire facility. By December 2018, after carrying out this work, the AS-15 was ready to begin testing, but due to difficult weather conditions it was not possible to go to sea. The station was sent to the boathouse, and on July 5, 2019, Zvezdochka received a letter from the leadership of the military unit to which the facility was assigned, from which it followed that a ban was being introduced on the operation of two types of lithium-ion batteries due to an accident at another facility.\n\nIt should be noted that on July 1, 2019, a fire occurred at the AS-31 deep-sea station, known as Losharik. 14 submariners were killed, RIA Novosti reported. As follows from the text of the court decision, the same batteries must be installed on the AS-15 as on the AS-31.\n\nZvezdochka attempted to find alternative equipment, but failed to replace the batteries. In this regard, in November 2020, Zvezdochka sent a letter to the Ministry of Defense to suspend the work under the government contract in this part. The Ministry of Defense held a series of meetings and decided to terminate the government contract for the work actually completed, taking into account the profitability of Zvezdochka.\n\nThe further fate of the AS-15 is unclear. In March 2021, TASS, citing its own sources, wrote that the AS-15 could be carried by the Belgorod nuclear submarine. The Mill.Press.Flot portal drew attention to the fact that in 2022 there was no information about the status of the AS-15 deep-sea station.

The pilot himself admitted this to members of the Federal Air Transport Commission. After the emergency landing in a field on September 12, the airline immediately removed this recommendation from crew briefing packets.\n\nAccording to the crew\u2019s explanations, at the time of making the decision to leave for an alternate airfield, the pilots were afraid that \u201cthey might receive a negative reaction from management\u201d if they landed in Omsk, contrary to the company\u2019s recommendations, where there was no opportunity to promptly fix a fault in the hydraulic system, as this could lead to delays in subsequent flights and additional costs, the report notes.
