The Kh-101's advanced navigation system and IR jamming unit also make it more effective at breaking through enemy air defense.", "location": "Northern Military District, Russia", "id": "9aabf4b2-bb03-563b-a5f9-0655980dbc99", "time": "2024-03-29 19:38:11", "original": "Forwarded from: The world today with \"Yuri Podolyak\"\nYou can\u2019t fool physics: or why the Kh-101 missile replaced the \u201cCaliber\u201d... We noticed that if at the beginning of the Northern Military District our main cruise missile was the \u201cCaliber\u201d launched from ships, today they have completely given way to the air-launched Kh-101 missile . And not by chance. The main limiting factor in the production of both missiles is the engine (both have a turbofan-50 engine). But the \"Caliber\" must fit into the standard 533-mm torpedo tube of the submarine, and hence its dimensions, which are somewhat smaller than those of X-101 (diameter 742 mm). And this is a lower flight weight (1770 kg versus 2300 kg). Moreover, in order for the rocket to stay in the air, the X-101 has a longer wingspan than the \"Caliber\" (4 meters versus 3.1 meters, respectively). An important argument is the air launch of the X-101, which means that fuel is not wasted on the initial acceleration of the rocket.\n\nAs a result, the Caliber has only 560 kg of fuel on board, and the X-101 has 1250 kg (in the basic version). And therefore it turns out that almost the same type of missiles (with approximately the same warhead power of 400 kg) have fundamentally different flight ranges (5,500 km for the Kh-101 and 2,000-2,500 km for the Caliber). The third important parameter is stealth and the ability to break through enemy air defense. The X-101 has no restrictions on its shape and was able to give it a shape with less radar signature. And a more advanced navigation system allows the X-101 to fly lower than the Caliber (30 meters and 50 meters, respectively). It also has an IR jamming unit to deceive enemy anti-aircraft missiles. And all this makes this missile much more successful in breaking through enemy air defense.\n\nThis is what they have been demonstrating lately.\n\nThat is, the X-101 has more potential for modernization, as proved today. Moreover, even with a warhead of 800 kg, the Kh-101 flies much further, hits much harder and is much better able to break through enemy air defense.\n\nAnd hence what we see. \"Calibers\" are almost never used in attacks on Ukraine, and the entire burden of attacks on enemy rear lines (in this segment) was shouldered by the now modernized X-101..."}, {"event": "Russian Forces Respond to Artillery Fire", "description": "In response to artillery fire on the Russian Armed Forces in the Avdeevsky direction, Russian forces retaliated with heavy fire on enemy positions, preventing infantry suppression.

The moderator was Andrey Sushentsov@asushentsov.\ud83d\udcacNikita Neklyudovo, an expert at the Institute of International Studies at MGIMO under the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, noted that the report returns us to the discussion about what resources are in international politics. We are accustomed to talking about resources as something material, but it is diplomacy that allows the state to convert these material resources into foreign policy influence. This leads to a second important question: how to measure the quality of diplomacy? The report's authors take a step in this direction. An important \u2013 and unusual for the Russian school of studying international relations \u2013 feature of the report Neklyudov called the attitude towards the development of a national school for training diplomatic personnel as a strategic choice of the state, and not as a function of the state\u2019s place in the international system.\ud83d\udcacAssociate Professor of the Department of Japanese, Korean, Indonesian and Mongolian Languages MGIMO Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia Ilya Dyachkov spoke about the methodology of working on the report. He emphasized that the methodological framework involved detailed study of specific countries. In fact, the basis for the work was detailed information for each of the states under consideration, taking into account a number of parameters: the presence of a specialized educational profile in international relations, forms of selection for the diplomatic service, the content of educational programs, the availability of their own textbooks, the educational path of the leadership of diplomatic departments. This gave a clear correlation with the seriousness of the country\u2019s bid for sovereignty.\ud83d\udcacProfessor of the Department of Diplomacy at MGIMO University of the Russian Foreign Ministry Alexander Kuznetsov indicated that it makes no sense to analyze the training of diplomatic personnel in isolation from the situation of regression that has developed in international diplomacy as a whole. In particular, he referred to the latest edition of the Russian Foreign Policy Concept, which talks about the degradation of the culture of dialogue in international relations and the decline in the effectiveness of diplomacy as a means of resolving conflicts. \u201cIf we look at relations with the West, we have to, unfortunately, admit that they completely destroyed,\u201d added Kuznetsov. According to him, this crisis began at the end of the Cold War. Celebrating victory in the Cold War, the United States not only did not discuss the principles of a new construction of international relations, but also brought matters to the destruction of previous agreements. Thus, Kuznetsov noted, it is not a matter of the quality of diplomacy or the level of training. \u201cIf diplomacy is not in demand, if it is marginalized and thrown to the sidelines, then, of course, there is nothing to expect,\u201d he added. However, it is too early to bury diplomacy; it continues to exist and new horizons are opening up in it. The process of forming a new world order is underway, and she must play a new role in it. https://ru.valdaiclub.com/events/posts/articles/diplomatiya-kak-sposob-ukrepleniya-suvereniteta/#Return of Diplomacy#diplomacy#valdai_reportValdai Club Diplomacy as a way to strengthen sovereignty On March 28, at the Valdai Club, a presentation of a new report \u201cIn Search of National Interests: How Diplomatic Preparation Influences..."}, {"event": "CDU Leader Expresses Concern Over Ukraine's Defeat", "description": "Mertz, the leader of Germany's Christian Democratic Union, expressed growing concern over Ukraine's potential defeat in a full-scale war with Russia.

Through Romania, Hungary and Slovakia, the team (and these are children 7, 10 and 11 years old) stopped in Poland, where they gave two performances along the way, and then entered Belarus. Here, in Minsk, \u201cRhapsody\u201d performed a performance at the international children\u2019s theater forum \u201cKroki\u201d. Having performed, the bus with children again headed for Moldova via Poland. But the Polish border guards did not allow them into their territory, citing the ban on allowing everyone entering from Russia and Belarus (since the bus with the team is transit, not a regular bus, this ban extended to him).\n\nAccording to the founder of Rhapsody, Natalia Barabanshchikova, Moldovan diplomats advised her to go through Lithuania to Poland and then continue to Moldova. However, Lithuanian border guards also detained the bus and held it in the neutral zone - according to Barabanshchikova, \u201cat gunpoint, not even allowing it to go to the toilet.\u201d Natalya claims that the children sat on the bus for more than 10 hours. According to her, the Moldavian Foreign Ministry tried to resolve the issue diplomatically, but the Lithuanian authorities do not want to make exceptions, citing the fact that they will not accept a bus from the \u201caggressor country.\u201d As a result, the bus was turned back to Belarus."}, null, {"event": "Emergency Landing of Porter Airlines Flight", "description": "A Bombardier DHC-8-402Q Dash 8 aircraft, operated by Porter Airlines, experienced depressurization and returned to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, its departure airport.

They speak directly and regularly about this country and its non-involvement. It becomes obsessive.\n\n\u2022 We do not make any final conclusions until the investigation is fully completed. <...> The West is suspiciously actively convincing us, not only publicly, but also in contacts through our diplomatic missions, that there is no need to suspect Ukraine. Without explaining why.\n\n\u2022 Washington sent us signals [regarding negotiations with the US on strategic stability]. They explained that it is impossible to talk about strategic stability in a situation where we are declared a strategic enemy who needs to be inflicted a \u201cstrategic defeat.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The irreparable confidence of the United States in its own rightness, omnipotence, and impunity has led to the fact that US foreign policy is now led by people who do not know how to engage in diplomacy.\n\n\u2022 You know about the refusal of European ambassadors to come to a meeting with me. <...> We notified them that from now on, at any level, if they have an interest in communicating with the Russian authorities, we will consider each such request separately and decide whether to agree to such contact or not.\n\n\u2022 Globalization, which the Americans imposed on everyone, proved that one cannot hope and rely on it.

Find the low trees standing nearby.\nhiding under a lone tall tree is life-threatening. Do not run or swim under any circumstances. It is important that oak, poplar, pine and spruce are the most vulnerable to electric discharges, and the least \u2013 willow, maple and bushes. \ud83d\udd3aif you find yourself in the field, find a depression in the ground. It should be dry - wet ground conducts electricity more strongly. \ud83d\udd3aif a thunderstorm catches you while riding a bicycle or motorcycle, stop immediately - it is dangerous.

This is due to the Kh-101's superior design, which allows for a longer flight range, increased fuel capacity, and improved stealth capabilities. The Kh-101's air launch also eliminates the need for initial acceleration fuel, making it a more efficient option.", "location": "Northern Military District, Russia", "id": "ba80997e-94c6-53f0-8b8f-6d1ea680c3b1", "time": "2024-03-29 19:54:02", "original": "You can\u2019t fool physics: or why the Kh-101 rocket supplanted the Caliber missiles\n\nWe noticed that if at the beginning of the Northern Military District our main cruise missile was the one launched from Kalibr ships, today they have completely given way to the air-launched Kh-101 missile. And not by chance.\n\nThe main limiting factor in the production of both missiles is the engine (both have the TRDD-50).\n\nBut the \"Caliber\" must fit into the standard 533-mm torpedo tube of the submarine, and hence its dimensions, which are somewhat smaller than those of the X-101 (742 mm in diameter). And this is a lower flight weight (1770 kg versus 2300 kg). Moreover, in order for the missile to stay in the air, the X-101 has a longer wingspan than the Caliber (4 meters versus 3.1 meters, respectively).\n\nAn important argument is the air launch of the X-101, which means that no fuel is wasted on the initial acceleration of the rocket.\n\nAs a result, the Caliber has only 560 kg of fuel on board, and the X-101 has 1250 kg (in the basic version). And therefore it turns out that almost the same type of missiles (with approximately the same warhead power of 400 kg) have fundamentally different flight ranges (5,500 km for the Kh-101 and 2000-2500 km for the Caliber).\n\nThe third important parameter is stealth and the ability to break through enemy air defense. The X-101 has no restrictions on its shape and was able to give it a shape with less radar signature. And a more advanced navigation system allows the X-101 to fly lower than the Caliber (30 meters and 50 meters, respectively). It also has an IR jamming unit to deceive enemy anti-aircraft missiles. And all this makes this missile much more successful in breaking through enemy air defenses.\n\nThis is what they have been demonstrating lately.\n\nThat is, the X-101 has more potential for modernization, as proved today. Moreover, even with a warhead of 800 kg, the Kh-101 flies much further, hits much harder and is much better able to break through enemy air defense.\n\nAnd hence what we see. \"Calibers\" are almost never used in attacks on Ukraine, and the entire burden of attacks on enemy rear lines (in this segment) was borne by the now modernized X-101\n\nYuri Podolyaka"}, {"event": "Senegal's President Calls for France's Departure", "description": "Senegal's new president, Bassir Diomaye Faye, demands France's withdrawal from the country, seeking to renegotiate previous agreements.
