At the very least, the process is becoming more complicated.\n\n-Another consequence will be a sharp increase in the required fuel consumption for the operation of many generators. Which automatically increases the load on logistics, which is already reduced by 4 times by railway. And transferring to highways requires a lot more people, while the drivers there are already in trouble due to mobilization. Plus, logistics centers are already overloaded, and the condition of the roads is sad.\n\n-another consequence is difficulty in the operation of the information dome.

The launches are massive - from 30 to 70 UAVs are used in one raid. The Ukrainian side cannot stop these attacks. The only thing that remains is to fight drones in the air, but every month, due to thinning air defense and the growth of drone production, this is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nSecondly, information about the flights of cruise missiles and even the detailed routes of their deceptive maneuvers are tracked not only by the Ukrainian military, but also by the entire air/electronic reconnaissance of NATO forces, into which the Ukrainian air defense system has been quite tightly integrated almost since the beginning of the Northern Military District. However, nothing can still be done with the vast majority of X-101/X-555 missiles. Of course, there are isolated cases of missiles being hit, and some fail in flight, but their number is negligible compared to the breaking through X-101s and fits into the order to hit targets.\n\nThirdly, apparently, the air defense of the Sumy, Zhytomyr, Rivne, Ternopil and Khmelnytsky regions, not to mention Lviv and especially the central region with Kiev, operate with significant restrictions. With each missile strike, the Kh-101s enter from a predetermined direction, fly over several areas, circle for some time in Ukrainian airspace and then hit targets. Western Patriot/NASAMS/SAMP-T air defense systems are either not activated at all or are activated in the most critical situation.\n\nUnderstanding the flight routes of cruise missiles does not help the Ukrainian side in any way in this regard.
