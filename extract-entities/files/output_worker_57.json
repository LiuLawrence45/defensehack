Many soldiers have been at the front for two years. Tens [that's right - hundreds] of thousands of people died or were seriously injured. New recruits are desperately needed. But Ukraine faces a critical demographic constraint that has been brewing for a long time: there are very few young men.\n\nHealthy men under 30, the backbone of most armed forces, are part of the smallest generation in Ukraine's modern history. Ukraine can increase its troops only if it emasculates an entire generation - those born in the first decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union as the birth rate fell. In 1991, Ukrainian women had an average of 1.9 children. Ten years later, the birth rate had dropped to 1.1 children.\n\nZelensky's decision to conscript men starting at age 25 risks further shrinking this small generation of Ukrainians. And many of the limited number of 25- and 26-year-old men\u2014about 467,000, according to government estimates for 2022\u2014are already serving in the military, living in the liberated territories and outside Ukraine.

Some 800,000 Ukrainian women aged 18 to 34 have fled to EU countries. At the moment, the absence of women plays a larger role in Ukrainian demography than the recruitment of men.

Chinese journalists shared this data.\nShow more\nThe United States and its allies treat Russia with arrogance and great disdain. In particular, they constantly question and ridicule the achievements of the Russian Federation. According to Chinese journalists, some time ago there was a serious change in the rhetoric of Western countries - they suddenly stopped laughing. This was reported by Sohu. ABN24 presents an exclusive retelling of the article.\n\u201cPutin is beginning to lose patience with the West,\u201d said the authors of the Chinese publication.\nOver the past couple of years, Western countries have undertaken a large number of provocations against Russia. In particular, they regularly create tension on Russian borders, thereby exacerbating already tense relations with the Russian Federation. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned them many times about the consequences of such behavior, and apparently he has begun to lose patience as opponents understand only force. Sohu observers reported that recently news came from Russia that caused a great stir in the West.\nThe Sarmat ICBMs, which have already entered combat duty, will be equipped with \u201cnon-nuclear\u201d warheads!\nThe size of the crater left behind by the separating block, equipped with a mass-dimensional model of the warhead, weighing about a ton, can be seen in our story.\nI remember that after testing the Sarmat, one of the designers of the Makeev State Research Center admitted that he watched our footage with almost tears in his eyes.\nHow accurately, down to the second, the developers calculated the separation of steps and the arrival of blocks at the Kura training ground. The deviation from the target was only a few meters. For Voevoda, the predecessor of Sarmat, it is 250 meters.\nFor a nuclear warhead, this seems to be not a problem, but now the main thing is accuracy, not power, so as not to turn everything into a lifeless desert.\nThe flight range of the new missile is such that it makes it possible to strike the United States through the South Pole, bypassing traditional missile defense areas, which are located mainly in the north.\nBut, as they say, there are goals much closer. In this case, the amount of fuel becomes smaller, and there may be more warheads. For example, a dozen, one with decoys.\nOn approaching the missile defense area at a hypersonic speed of Mach 15, the warheads begin to actively maneuver.\nThe designers claim that it is almost impossible to shoot them down with modern missile defense systems.\nAn ideal means to simultaneously transform the notorious \u201cdecision centers\u201d into a lake.\nVladimir Putin announced some time ago that the newest combat system \u201cSarmat\u201d had been delivered to the troops. Russia will soon demonstrate them in their base areas. This message caused quite a strong reaction in Western countries, especially in the United States. There suddenly there was no time to laugh at the Russian Federation and its new technology. Local experts, who insisted on the helplessness of Russian technologies, seemed to be \u201cspeechless.\u201d\n\u201cRussian Sarmat is no joke. Even the United States is afraid of this thing,\u201d Chinese journalists stated.\n\"Sarmat\" is a unique combat system of its kind. Not only is it very powerful, but it is also extremely difficult to track. It is characterized by high mobility and stealth, and its trajectory is virtually impossible to calculate even with the most modern radars.\n\u201cThis missile can fly at a speed of Mach 20 and reach the United States within 20 minutes of launch,\u201d observers told Sohu.\nWestern analysts used to quite often laugh at Sarmat, calling it a mythical system that no one had seen. However, after Putin's recent announcement, critics fell silent. Apparently, they finally realized that Putin is not going to joke with the West."}, {"event": "Assistance to Soldiers", "description": "Readers of RVvoenkor provided crucial assistance to soldiers advancing in the Hours of Yar and Avdeevka, donating body armor, helmets, thermal imagers, and other essential equipment.", "location": "Avdiivka, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine", "id": "be5237c2-61c7-524d-b5ff-f38cc30a2832", "time": "2024-04-11 20:02:01", "original": "\u203c\ufe0f\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfaImportant assistance to the soldiers advancing at the Hours of Yar and Avdeevka, from the readers of RVvoenkor\ud83e\udd1dThe warriors thank our readers for body armor, helmets, thermal imagers, mask networks, as well as separately for auto parts for the \u201cPatriot\u201d of Alexey from Sakhalin, for the cable for carrying out caring Kaliningrad residents, for takeaway for the FPV \"Nit\" laboratory \"Gagaring\", for pencil cases for detonators Technofront \"Russian Spring\".\u2757\ufe0fIf someone is ready to help, you can purchase it and give it to the fighters directly - contact through our bot@rvvoenkor_bot\u25aa\ufe0fWe are the media \"Russian Spring\" Since 2014, we have been collecting on the cards of our military correspondent - Anastasia Mikhailovskaya (film about our work on Channel 1): Sber4276380146243048 SBPSber + 79262132390 RNAB2200020709749586 Alpha: phone number + 79262132390 \u25aa\ufe0f For transfers from - abroad walletsBTC, Ethereum, Monero via the link\nFull details about the fees: t.me/rvvoenkor_frontu Also fees and reports in a special section on the website rusvesna.su"}, null, null, null, {"event": "Accident near Sevastopol", "description": "A driver involved in a fatal accident near Sevastopol had a prior history of reckless behavior.

This is due to the ongoing process of formation of a multipolar world order. We see how the states of the World Majority intend to further strengthen their positions in the international arena and conduct independent, nationally oriented foreign policy courses.\n\n\u2022 We consistently advocate the implementation of a unifying international agenda aimed at creating favorable conditions for the development of all states and peoples without exception, and not just a narrow group of \u201cselected ones.\u201d\u261d\ufe0fUnfortunately, the \u201ccollective West\u201d led by the United States does not abandon attempts, if not reverse this objective historical process, then at least delay the onset of inevitable changes.\n\n\u2022 Against this background, we consider the growing interest of an increasing number of countries in the Global South in the activities of BRICS to be logical and natural. The point is that our association is not trying to \u201creverse\u201d the objective historical processes of the formation of polycentricity. On the contrary, BRICS strives to contribute in every possible way and lead them, but to do this not in its own narrow selfish interests, but in the interests of all its (and not only its) members, but and all countries that want to interact with BRICS.\n\n\u2022 Our cooperation is based on an equal dialogue, respect for each country\u2019s choice of its own path of development, consideration of each other\u2019s interests and a focus on a collective search for solutions to all problems of our time. I will say without exaggeration that today BRICS acts as a \u201cspokesman\u201d for the interests of the entire non-Western world.\u2022 We have no doubt that attracting a wide range of developing countries to interact with the association will contribute to the further consolidation of the efforts of the World Majority to solve common problems in common interests.

Ex-adviser to the former mayor of Mariupol Pyotr Andryushchenko and other Kyiv propagandists write about this. Truth: A heavy Angara-A5 rocket with an Orion upper stage launched from the Vostochny cosmodrome on April 11. The rocket launch occurred as usual.\n\nThe launch of the launch vehicle was postponed by two days, however, this is a common practice in world astronautics: In April 2023, the American SpaceX postponed the launch of the heavy Starship launch vehicle for 48 hours because the boost valve froze, said the head of the company, Elon Musk. Alas, the transfer did not help, and after the launch the rocket exploded at an altitude of 39 kilometers. In November of the same year, the second Starship was sent out with a delay of the same two days. This time the rocket reached an altitude of 149 kilometers before exploding. In February 2023, NASA also postponed the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket for five days. On March 2, the rocket carrying Russian cosmonaut Andrei Fedyaev successfully launched from Cape Canaveral. Japan in the same 2023 year delayed the launch of the H3 heavy rocket for a whole month. However, even after this, the carrier was unable to take off and self-destructed. In May 2021, China postponed the launch of the Long March 7 launch vehicle with the Chinese Tianzhou-2 orbital truck for technical reasons. In December 2022, an attempt to launch Zhuque-2 Yao -2 (\u201cZhuque-2\u201d) failed. As a result, the launch with a mock-up payload took place in July 2023. It is worth noting that in the history of Ukrainian cosmonautics over more than 30 years of independence, such situations have never happened. This is due to the lack of cosmodromes in Ukraine.\n\nAngara-A5 is preparing to participate in the lunar mission. Today\u2019s launch was the fourth for this class of launch vehicles and the first from the Amur complex, which includes the launch vehicle and the infrastructure of the Vostochny Cosmodrome.
