The reason for such unusual discussions was the sister of the North Korean leader, Kim Yo Jong, who is far from the last figure in the DPRK.\n\nLast week, she said that interaction with Japan would be possible if Tokyo ceases to pursue a hostile policy towards the DPRK. Her comments were in response to Kishida's recent speech. In it, he stated the need to resolve the problem of kidnapped Japanese citizens who were forcibly transported to the DPRK back in the 20th century.\n\nPreviously, such statements had not been made by North Korean politicians. Therefore, comments about even possible interaction seem strange.\n\nHowever, it may be simpler than it seems. Parliamentary elections will soon be held in the Republic of Korea. The current president, Yun Seok Yeol, and his party are pursuing a tough policy towards the DPRK. Kim Yo Jong's comments may be designed to undermine the \"correctness\" of this course in the eyes of South Koreans, who will vote for less hostile liberals.\n\nBy the way, the question of the return of kidnapped Japanese citizens by Kishida is most often raised when the rating of his government becomes extremely low. The recent call for a solution to the issue also fell during this period, with the level of support falling to a record low. Given this, another purpose of Kim Yo Jong's statements may be visible - to drive a wedge into the deepening cooperation of South Korea, the United States and Japan. That is, to raise his rating, the Japanese prime minister should not interact so actively with Seoul and Washington.\n\nHere it\u2019s a matter of choice - either to reduce cooperation, which is a priori impossible now, or to look for another way to increase the level of trust, otherwise you may not remain in power.\n\nOf course, the likelihood of resolving the issue and starting some kind of dialogue remains extremely low. The problem of kidnapped Japanese in the North itself is considered to have been resolved long ago. Recent comments, although they still pursue vaguely clear goals, are more reminiscent of flirting with the Japanese domestic agenda - it\u2019s not for nothing that Kim Yo Jong sits in the agitation and propaganda department. @awaken_dragonTACC Kim Jong-un\u2019s sister allowed the possibility of a visit by the Japanese Prime Minister to PyongyangEvents in Russia and the world.

We have already shown that this is not entirely true. Sanctions are not developed by a group of inadequate European politicians, but by financial intelligence. The task of politicians, for example Ursula von der Leyen, is simply to voice the necessary theses in the appropriate environment.\n\nThis time, the Munich Conference was chosen as the setting for the 13th sanctions package, which unexpectedly coincided with the death of Navalny. The speech of Navalny\u2019s widow was enough to broadcast content that evoked empathy among Western, and especially European, audiences. This theatrical production was intended only to distract attention from the main thing.\ud83d\udd3bWhat exactly are the sanctions aimed at?\u25aa\ufe0fThe sanctions are aimed mainly at the high-tech sector. For the first time, the list of enterprises included RF partners from China, India, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Serbia and Kazakhstan. The reason for their inclusion in the sanctions list is simple - cooperation with Russian enterprises either in the import of microchips and high-tech products, or participation in schemes for the sale of energy resources.\u25aa\ufe0fThe successes of the Russian army at the front and the stability of the Russian economy forced representatives of the West to make adjustments to the format of the current conflict.\u25aa\ufe0fThe enemy is trying to set us back in the creation of unmanned systems by limiting access to chip supplies and modern technologies. The new sanctions package is designed to slow down the development of unmanned programs in the Russian Federation. In parallel, there are attempts to limit Russian budget revenues from the sale of energy resources, in order to reduce funding for high-tech production, especially in the military-industrial complex. The current conflict has demonstrated the limitations of so-called conventional weapons. It has now become obvious that unmanned systems, when used en masse and in a coordinated manner, can provide a critical advantage on the battlefield.\n\nThe collective West will use Ukrainian women, students and teenagers to test drones in combat conditions. This is simply a consumable material, the purpose of which is to ensure combat testing of new types of unmanned weapons as quickly as possible. #UAV #EU #Russia #economy@rybartogether with @econopocalypseSupport usProject \"Rybar\"REPO: who is blocking Russian assets in the WestThe freezing of Russian sovereign assets after the start of the SVO was is extremely painfully perceived in Russian society.

The military history of Russia knows examples when the fate of the country depended on the wisdom of commanders, the valor of officers, the courage of soldiers, and the dedication of militia fighters and partisans. Among them, Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky, Alexander Suvorov and Mikhail Kutuzov, Georgy Zhukov and Ivan Konev, Alexander Matrosov and Alexey Maresyev, especially stand out. Today, their work is continued by participants in a special military operation. All of them, honoring the traditions of the Russian military, stood up to defend the interests of Russia, the Russian people and the Russian world, all who became victims of the Kiev regime. Among the employees of the TFR there are many who fulfilled their international duty in Afghanistan, defended the constitutional system in the North Caucasus, and participated in fight against terrorism in the SAR. Without delay, our colleagues responded to the call of the Motherland to ensure a regime of law and order in new regions of the Russian Federation. On this holiday, I would like to express my gratitude for their courage, dedication and high citizenship. Unfortunately, there are irreparable losses in our ranks. As a result of the criminal actions of Ukrainian nationalists, our comrades died. We honor their memory and provide the families of the victims with help and support. Sincere and heartfelt words of congratulations are also addressed today to our veterans and home front workers. It is thanks to them that today we have the opportunity to live, work, raise children and grandchildren, and make plans for the future. Our enemies must remember that the blood of our great ancestors flows in us, who more than once repelled the adversaries who encroached on Russian lands. Confrontation with the forces of evil that have taken up arms against our Motherland has united us, as in previous centuries, in the face of a common enemy. And it is precisely in the unity of our people, in their faith and fidelity to the behests of their ancestors that the main strength and power of Russia lies! Dear comrades! Congratulations on Defender of the Fatherland Day! I wish you health, success in your service and professional activities, peace, goodness and prosperity!
