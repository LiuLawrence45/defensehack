A note from the channel \u201cUncle Zhora\u2019s Dugout\u201d.\nVideo\n+\n\"\"Caught a grunt\"\nShow more\nFear is commonplace in war. Fighters face him all the time. Some people get used to it, others find it difficult. It happens that fear breaks experienced, already seasoned fighters. Those who have been in such situations more than once from where they do not return alive and have shown themselves to be excellent there.\nFear can bind you and stop you from doing anything. Panic thoughts and moods will immediately creep into your head. Under this sauce of feelings, it is already difficult to continue to carry out the combat mission. One of the names for this condition is \u201cgrunt\u201d or \u201ccaught a grunt.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just the soldiers on the front line who are caught in the sniff; fear and panic can be found in the rear, even in some headquarters.\nYou don\u2019t need to explain why \u201cgrunting\u201d is dangerous and why it is unacceptable in various situations. But if you see that someone next to you, while performing any task, has \u201ccaught a grunt\u201d, a fighter or, God forbid, a commander, must suppress and stop this phenomenon in every possible way.\nIn the endless plans for combat training of future fighters, there is not even a hint of an analysis of the issue of \u201cgrunting\u201d. Fucking instructors who think that by shooting at the feet of the trainees, they thereby gave them a lesson on how to overcome the \u201cgrunt\u201d in future battles, do not understand about the \u201cgrunt\u201d at all. And there is also a collective \u201cgrunt.\u201d I won\u2019t even talk about political officers. The working sample floor is more of an exception.\nLearn to deal with the \u201cgrunt\u201d while still on the shore. Explain that fear must be overcome and help others do it. Always highlight the display of courage in fighters. You can shoot \u201cBill Drill\u201d better than anyone, know and do all types of reloads, recite all the regulations and instructions by heart. But to fuck up the opornik without even entering the battle. A well-trained fighter, but by nature a waste of time for everyone. Cultivating courage is what should be at the top of combat training. Everyone can be taught to shoot and act competently. But only fighters for whom \u201cgrunting\u201d is not a hindrance can realize their skills in battle.\u201d"}, {"event": "LPR Residents Apply for Russian Passports", "description": "Over 600,000 residents of the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) applied for Russian passports in 2023 through the migration divisions of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs.

Lavrov for the documentary project \u201cOil\u201d (March 21, 2024) Question: We proceed from the fact that oil is an instrument of political manipulation. The most severe energy crisis of 1973 was the result of political manipulation in response to the Yom Kippur War. Do you agree Show more that oil is a tool of political manipulation? Maybe you have more striking examples or vice versa? Sergey Lavrov: Of course, any natural resources on which economic development, influence and power depend are the subject of political struggle. Of course, they are used for political purposes, including geopolitical ones. This was in the 1980s, when the United States, through colossal pressure on Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries (the main oil producers), achieved a collapse in oil prices (to ten dollars per barrel, or even lower) in the hope of reducing the capabilities of the Soviet Union. Union to receive foreign exchange earnings, develop and ensure its security. At that time, our slogan \u201ccompete with the USA and the West\u201d still remained. They achieved their goal. The income of the Soviet Union fell sharply. This was one of the reasons (not the main and only one) why the Soviet Union ceased to exist. This was pressure on the oil market, a \u201cbearing game\u201d, the involvement of the Soviet Union in the arms race, the promotion of \u201cdemocratic reforms\u201d in a country that was not ready for this. All this consistently played a role in the fact that the great country ceased to exist. Since then, oil and oil prices have been constantly used as a weapon by the Americans. There are examples concerning Iran, when it was banned from exporting oil and all possible supply channels were blocked in spite of this illegal ban. Iran has now emerged from oil sanctions. The last most striking example is Venezuela. Back in 2019, it was the third main oil supplier to the United States. In 2022, in the fight against the \u201cregime,\u201d as they put it, N. Maduro, the Americans declared an embargo. Then they felt the consequences of the actions of OPEC and OPEC Plus to stabilize the market and take into account the key economic factors of their policy, built to ensure a balance between producers, importers and transit countries. Now the Americans are trying to start new political games around Venezuela, offering it an agreement to resume the export of its oil to the United States in exchange for some political concessions. But it\u2019s a fact that they were a little \u201cburnt\u201d by the consequences of their own actions. A huge number of American oil refineries were set up to process Venezuelan oil. There is an interweaving of purely economic factors and those that show a desire to use economic ties. In this case, trading oil as a weapon. If we talk about the Russian Federation. What is a certain ceiling on prices for Russian oil artificially introduced by the Americans and under their dictate by the rest of the West? This is a gross interference in the very market forces and free market principles that Americans have been promoting to everyone else for decades. They characterized the dollar as not an American currency, but as a common asset that ensures the interconnectedness of the world economy and finance. All this went to waste as soon as they needed to use these tools in order, as they proclaimed, to inflict a \u201cgeopolitical defeat\u201d on the Russian Federation.\u201d It is clear that these unscrupulous actions are not welcomed by anyone. Although few people (especially in the West) dare to say this out loud. The apotheosis of the use of hydrocarbons as weapons is sabotage on the Nord Stream, directly directed against Germany. American analysts already recognize this and many in Germany are beginning to openly emphasize this. This shows the powerlessness of the current German leadership and its inability not only to think independently, but even to protect its vital interests, on which the welfare and well-being of the citizens of Germany depends. As a result of this sabotage and terrorist act, business from Germany and other European countries, in the face of rising gas prices, began to move, including and above all, to the United States. They began to talk about the deindustrialization of Europe. A year ago, French Economy Minister B. Le Maire publicly stated that businesses pay four times more for energy in Europe than in the United States. I think it's a similar ratio now. It is a fact that in the USA they provided their businesses with much more favorable conditions, including by adopting a law on subsidies as part of the fight against inflation. Business is moving to the USA. At the same time, having blown up these gas pipelines, Washington directly, without even a pause, began to say, they say, you see, you don\u2019t have Russian gas, let\u2019s now buy our LNG, which is more expensive, for which there is no infrastructure, it needs to be built. I remember four years ago, when A. Merkel was still chancellor, the Americans even then, in less troubled times, convinced the Germans that they did not need any Nord Stream, they did not need any Russian gas at all; they say, buy their LNG. German Chancellor Angela Merkel then tried to object, saying that it was very difficult because it would be much more expensive. To which the Americans replied that yes, it\u2019s more expensive, but raise taxes. Explain, in the end, to your population that this is a good cause in the name of peace and democracy on the entire planet. There are many examples. Question: After 1975, after the assassination of King Faisal, Saudi Arabia was a staunch ally of the United States. Tying oil contracts to the dollar and creating petrodollars without the participation of Saudi Arabia was impossible. But in recent years the course has been changing away from the United States. Is this so and what is the reason? The main thing is how predictable is this path? Will it happen that we will lose the Saudis again and they will again fall into the wake of the United States? Sergey Lavrov: I would not say that they have taken a course away from the United States. They simply decided to pursue their national policy and that no one would interfere with them (neither from the left, nor from the right, nor from above, nor from below), including, first of all, the United States. This trend is consistent in Saudi Arabia. Especially with the appointment of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud as Prime Minister, who announced the Vision 2030 initiative. By this date, which in general is not far off, a lot remains to be done. A lot has already been done. Saudi Arabia is sincerely, based on the interests of its state, kingdom, and citizens, interested in ensuring that oil prices are stable and ensure normal profits for oil-producing countries. But at the same time they would be at a level that would be attractive to buyers. What we are now doing with them within the framework of OPEC+ and with the support of all other participants in this association is exactly about this. Saudi Arabia adheres to this line very clearly. We will not allow attempts to interfere in these processes. I read the other day that Ukraine is trying to convince the United States to lower the ceiling on the maximum price for Russian oil by half - to $30 per barrel. This generally goes beyond all limits, not to mention the fact that the very concept of a ceiling is anti-market and reflects the desire to dictate. But it is significant that the United States is unlikely to follow Ukraine\u2019s lead. If only because this could have economic consequences for the Americans themselves, and the oil market could seriously react. I hope that the United States still has some remnants of national pride and will not \u201cdance to the tune\u201d of V.A. Zelensky. Question: You have already talked about Venezuela. Our companies are really well represented there, in particular Rosneft. Chevron is now under US pressure. \u201cBolivar can handle two\u201d in this concept or will Venezuela have to choose? Sergey Lavrov: According to many estimates, Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world. We are, in principle, against monopolism. There's enough room for everyone. If only it were a fair game, a fair process for allocating opportunities to invest in the Venezuelan oil industry. Our Venezuelan friends understand very well what is happening. Of course they listen to the US. No one will deny the United States the opportunity to talk if Washington seriously wants to discuss something. Any normal country will be ready to listen. They are having this conversation, they want the sanctions lifted. In exchange, the Americans want from them not only concessions in the field of human rights and other democratic demands, which they regularly put forward, without much explanation of what is meant by this. Loyalty to the United States is the criterion of democracy as Washington understands it. But Venezuelans, of course, also remember that during the period when the embargo was in effect, the Americans took and sold at auction the American branch of the Venezuelan company PDVSA. Just. They actually requisitioned it. Washington's manners are well known. There will be no mutually beneficial approaches here. In a dialogue with Washington, you need to firmly push for your benefits, without really expecting that he will fulfill his \u201crosy\u201d promises. Question: We are becoming competitors with Iran in the oil market. Will it be friendly competition or will our interests not intersect in any way? Sergey Lavrov: I don\u2019t see any problems in the fact that Iran has restored its legal rights, which provide it with the opportunity to develop by selling oil, receiving income, investing the profits. Within the framework of OPEC+, of which both Iran and Russia are members, there is a clear understanding of how to negotiate and seek compromises. This scheme has been working for many years. No one is at a loss, no one is offended. Moreover, I think the hydrocarbon market will grow. China's growth rate has slowed slightly. But if you look at the numbers, they are two to three times higher than the rates that exist in many other countries, primarily in the West. India is growing even faster. Therefore, there will be no shortage of consumers. Take Africa. We have doubled the export of petroleum products there over the past year and a half. There is no fear here. Normal countries, basing their actions on international law, will always find a mutually acceptable balance of interests. Question: After the invention of the internal combustion engine, after the beginning of its active implementation, all wars on the planet are in one way or another connected with the struggle for the possession of oil-bearing territories. Do you agree with this idea? There are experts who are strongly against it, while others share it. What do you think? Sergey Lavrov: It depends from which side you look. The most recent known situation is a special military operation, combat operations in Ukraine. From a material point of view, they are provided one hundred percent by the United States and their NATO allies, as well as from the point of view of military personnel entirely by Ukrainians, mercenaries and instructors. It seems that the declared goal of this war against Russia is to prevent infringement of the sovereignty of Ukraine, restore territorial integrity, etc. We cannot ignore the fact that Russia is one of the leading powers producing and exporting oil and gas. Our country was the main supplier of gas to Europe. Gas pipelines, built during the Soviet Union, provided Europe, and especially Germany, with a comfortable existence and, by and large, prosperity for many decades. There were no beggars, no poverty on the scale seen in the United States. Even before the Nord Stream explosions, the West was forcing Europe to stop consuming Russian gas. He directly imposed his energy resources. Pursuing the goal of defeating Russia on the battlefield, as they now declare it, weakening it, removing it from the ranks of global players, many not only non-governmental organizations, but also political figures are already seriously declaring that Russia needs to be \u201cdecolonized.\u201d Puppet organizations \u201cfor freedom\u201d are being created abroad for individual Russian republics, etc. This is probably somehow connected with the desire to remove a country that competes with the United States in energy markets. Another case. There is a modern war going on in Syria. As part of the Arab Spring, the same attempt was made in the wake of the \u201cchanges\u201d brought about by NATO in Libya, destroying the state there, as well as in a number of other countries. We then came to the rescue quite unexpectedly for the Americans and those who were planning a complete regime change in Damascus. Until now, the \u201cregime\u201d of B. Assad (as they say) is a full member of the UN and enjoys the support of the majority of the population. But the US is not happy with this. When the United States, unlike us, illegally sent troops into northeast Syria, it chose an oil-bearing and major agricultural region. It is in the northeastern part that grain and oil production in Syria is concentrated. The Americans occupied it. They extract oil there, engaged in robbery. Every day, convoys are sent through Iraq to the addresses that the Americans designate for themselves. This is direct colonialism. There's nothing more to talk about. At the same time, in the same territories in northeast Syria, occupied by the Americans, the Americans \u201ckeep\u201d camps. Formally, they are called refugee camps. Bandits are trained there, including the terrorist organizations Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and derivatives of this structure banned by the UN Security Council, to carry out sabotage in the interests of the United States in the most parts of the world, including against us in Ukraine. You see, here oil and geopolitics are inextricably linked. Question: You said that the collapse of the USSR was partly provoked by the collapse of oil prices. When the USSR collapsed, one of the first economic laws was to change the law \u201cOn Subsoil\u201d and transfer oil into private hands, including foreign ones. \u201cProduction Sharing Agreement\u201d, etc. Now there are two opposing points of view. Some people think that this was vitally necessary, it was necessary to save the economy... Sergey Lavrov: This is not for me. This is not for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to comment on. This will be an introduction into someone else's sphere of competence. Besides, I knew many of those people well... Question: We all know them well. Then a \u201cchildish\u201d question. Your first association that comes to mind. Oil is... Sergey Lavrov: I\u2019ve never thought about it. Question: What if right away? Oil is... Sergey Lavrov: If we talk about associations. Now I remembered that there is Neft vodka. Black small barrel. Including this. Russian President V.V. Putin has spoken on this topic more than once, commenting on the \u201cgreen transition\u201d initiatives, the acceleration of which in the vast steppe caused a food and energy crisis when they stopped investing in hydrocarbons, relying on the sun, wind and water. In Europe, those who support the climate agenda, including the \u201cgreens\u201d in Germany and related parties, put their political ambitions above logic and economic interests. So people started thinking about oil more often. Not only about her. All plans for an instant \u201cgreen transition\u201d collapsed: either the wind was blowing wrong, there was not enough sun, or the tides were not right. Now in Europe coal is used with all its might, more than in Africa. We recently attended the BRICS summit. Africans on the sidelines complained that the Europeans continued to put pressure on them, that, let\u2019s invest in the \u201cgreen economy\u201d, \u201cgreen transition\u201d, give up coal. And they themselves burn coal much more than until recently. And much more than others. So oil and gas, hydrocarbons in general, will certainly play a key role in the development of the world economy and ensuring the well-being of almost all countries of the world for a long time, for decades. Question: We are now turning oil flows to the East to China and India. It is clear that our colleagues, today\u2019s partners, will look for favorable economic conditions for themselves. Will it turn out that we are trading oil at a loss? Sergey Lavrov: No. I don\u2019t see such threats at all. I have already said that both China and India are growing rapidly. They can \u201cabsorb\u201d proposals from many OPEC+ member countries. The organization regulates the market and prices honestly, fairly, taking into account the interests of consumers. OPEC+ will not set prices that are unacceptable to buyers. This is that fair balance of interests. I am not afraid of dependence on countries that will buy our oil and gas, and are already buying in ever-increasing volumes. We must beware of those who blow up the already existing infrastructure that ensured prosperity for European countries. They were told, you know, these are \u201cbad molecules.\u201d You need gas with \u201cdemocratic molecules.\u201d Justice will still prevail. https://vk.cc/cvAYG2"}, null, {"event": "Meeting with Mayor of Gorlovka", "description": "Pavel Kukushkin met with Ivan Sergeevich Prikhodko, the mayor of Gorlovka, in his office.

Approval from the US Department of State's Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) was received on March 19.\n\nThe purchase includes 612 missiles, about 200 launchers, as well as sets of Lightweight Command Launch Units (LWCLUs). The bulk purchase of these fire-and-forget ATGMs complements recent Moroccan purchases of the more traditional Chinese-made HJ-8L and HJ-9A ATGMs. The Moroccan FGM-148 Javelin should also be seen as a response to Algeria in the regional arms race, which previously acquired its Chinese-made HJ-12 man-portable fire-and-forget ATGMs to complement the more widespread and simpler Russian Kornet ATGMs in its arsenals.\n\nThus, the club of armies of owners of portable ATGMs operating on the fire-and-forget principle continues to grow. The main reason is that they have a rare set of properties. Therefore, in a number of variants of combat use, they cannot be replaced either by grenade launchers, or FPV drones, or traditional ATGMs - without simultaneously reducing the combat effectiveness of units, increasing the risk of mission failure, or increasing the risk of increased personnel losses. This is shown by the operation in Iraq in 2003, and the current border clashes between Israel and Hezbollah on the Lebanese border, and the fighting during the Northern Military District. Therefore, as a \u201cniche ATGM\u201d, such systems do not replace, but quite harmoniously complement more widespread and cheaper traditional systems.\n\nAnd although China, Iran, South Korea, Israel, and Japan have established the production of similar systems, the American FGM-148 is the most popular on the market.

Let us recall the story: on the website of the organization headed by Semigin, there was a post signed by him, which fiercely approved the beating of Nikita Zhuravel by Adam Kadyrov in the pre-trial detention center of Grozny, and also reported the following: \u201cIf every Russian soldier defended his ideals as uncompromisingly as the son of Ramzan Akhmatovich, then perhaps the Akhmat battalion would not have to kick the soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces onto the battlefield.\u201d Many TG channels, including Topaz, then threw a hatful of unpleasant comments at Semigin. Now he has filed a lawsuit to protect his honor and dignity. This is a very dangerous adversary, a representative of that same Soviet nomenklatura. Judge for yourself: Family. Father Colonel of the Strategic Missile Forces - these guys were supposed to turn the whole world into dust if necessary. Mother is an engineer by training, worked somewhere next to her husband, also a difficult person. Place of birth. Of course, from the territories of the Ukrainian SSR - the city of Dunaevtsy, Khmelnitsky region. Education. As many as 3 higher education: Riga Higher Military-Political School named after. Marshal of the Soviet Union S.S. Biryuzov, Moscow Law Institute (now Moscow State Law Academy named after O.E. Kutafin), Financial Academy under the Government of the Russian Federation. Candidate of Political Science already in 1993, Doctor in 1996 (at 32!). Biography is even more interesting. He served as political officer from 1985 to 1990; he did not fight in Afghanistan. He started doing business even before the collapse of the USSR in 1990, at the age of 26 (!), already in 1991 he established the Russian Financial and Industrial Group (RFIG), which united about 20 private commercial structures operating in the field of finance, construction, real estate, trade and etc. He led the RFPG until 1996. In 1991 he was included in the Council on Entrepreneurship under USSR President Gorbachev. Since 1999, member of the State Duma and immediately deputy chairman. From 2002 to 2005, director of the Institute of Political Science of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Having managed to be the chairman of the \u201cshadow government of Russia\u201d, which the opposition created literally in parallel with the one in force in 2005 (can you imagine such a body now? Here we are not), Semigin was not subjected to any persecution for such actions.\nReturned to the State Duma in 2019, holds the position of Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Nationalities Affairs. Zlawyers resume. Gennady Semigin is a most dangerous opponent, a real mastodon who has managed to stay in the highest echelons of power for more than 30 years. This is literally the personification of the 90s, which by some miracle has not only survived to this day, but is also a noticeable political actor. We think the delay in going to court is due to Semigin\u2019s long search for some kind of support from patrons, so it will be extremely difficult to cope with it.\n\nOn the other hand, the result of the Topaz v. Semigin case will be the answer to the question of whether our government is ready to turn away from the Soviet nomenklatura in favor of the new elite - members of the SVO.

This situation arose back in the 1930s, when the Transcaucasian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic existed. Of course, starting in 1988, when the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict flared up with a bright flame, no one paid attention to this circumstance; moreover, the Azerbaijani exclaves inside Armenia became the first objects of ethnic cleansing, since the leaders of the Armenian nationalists, being smart people, understood perfectly well that exclaves could become centers of Azerbaijani resistance to expulsion from the country, and therefore they must be dealt with first. At the end of the 1980s, the first blows were struck precisely at them, after which the actions of all the other 700 thousand ethnic Azerbaijanis living on the territory of the Armenian SSR began. So the issue of returning exclaves to Azerbaijan for official Baku is not only territorial and political, but also a matter restoration of historical justice and compensation for moral suffering. Speaking about the four former Azerbaijani village-exclaves in the Tavush region of Armenia, the speedy and unconditional return of which Baku demands from Yerevan today, we must keep in mind the following nuance: these settlements and their surroundings have never been inhabited by Armenians considered them theirs due to historical tradition, as was the case with Karabakh. For them, they were always a military prize, a trophy as a result of the occupation, which they never hid. And as soon as President Aliyev demanded that Prime Minister Pashinyan restore historical justice, this demand did not meet with a single more or less reasonable objection from the Armenian authorities simply because they had no grounds for this. That is why Prime Minister Pashinyan personally went to Tavush to convince local residents to vacate the houses and lands from which they expelled the Azerbaijanis 35 years ago.@Caucasian_bureau"}, {"event": "Ombudsman's Statement on Work in Crimea", "description": "The ombudsman in the Kherson region, Sergei Georgiev, expressed gratitude for the legal experience and reaction in search of non-standard solutions during the transition period in Crimea.", "location": "Simferopol, Crimea, Russia", "id": "ce41687f-c1f3-5813-8c86-c96cce6baeda", "time": "2024-03-21 11:13:33", "original": "Work in Crimea during the transition period \u201chardened\u201d - the ombudsman in the Kherson region. \u201cGrateful for the legal experience and reaction in search of non-standard solutions,\u201d Sergei Georgiev told RIA Novosti Crimea.

In addition, periods of military service in the structures of the DPR and LPR are currently not taken into account when providing benefits for the purchase of housing.\n\nWe propose that the Government, together with the State Duma and the Federation Council, adopt the necessary legal changes that will make it possible to take into account such service and maintain ranks and in the future receive the benefits required by law.\n\nIn addition, we propose to legislatively regulate situations where employees of law enforcement agencies, for example, the National Guard, have a preferential right to housing payments if their family has a disabled child, but their colleagues with military status do not.\n\nHe also reported to the President on the status of the proposals previously formulated by the Working Group:\u25aa\ufe0fA federal law was adopted on the abolition of the state duty for registration of equipment transferred free of charge to the Northern Military District zone.\u25aa\ufe0fA bill was introduced providing for the simultaneous receipt of disability and survivor pensions for disabled children and people with disabilities since childhood, whose parents died in the Northern Military District.\u25aa\ufe0fAmendments have been made to guarantee the preservation of the rights to the Arctic and Far Eastern hectares for the Northern Military District participants until they return from the front.\u25aa\ufe0fA bill on lowering insurance premiums for compulsory social insurance for working disabled combatants has been sent to the Government's conclusion.TelegramWorking Group on the Northern Military DistrictOfficial Telegram channel The working group on SVO issues led by A.A.

On Monday, the National Assembly voted in favor of a bill that would lift the ban on female genital mutilation (female circumcision). Although a final decision was delayed by three months, The Gambia is the first in the world to decriminalize a practice internationally recognized as a violation of human rights.\n\nCurrent legislation provides for fines and imprisonment for up to three years, and in the event of the death of the victim, a life sentence. However, up to 73% of women and girls aged 15 to 49 have undergone the procedure, with 65% under the age of 5, and due to problems with law enforcement, cases almost never reach court.\n\n\u201cFemale circumcision\u201d is practiced by 7 of the country\u2019s 9 ethnic groups, with the Mandinka, Diola and Hausa, who make up 52% of the population, practicing its \u201cmild\u201d form (so-called type 2) - partial or complete removal of the clitoris and labia minora without excision large in girls 10-15 years old, Soninka (9%) - \u201clight\u201d clitoridectomy on newborns (up to 1 week), and Fulbe (18%) - the most severe (type 3) - \u201csuturing\u201d the vagina in girls and women aged from 1 week to 18 years.\n\nIn general, circumcision is considered as part of female initiation (nyaka), during which, incl. Through songs and music, girls learn gender norms that are key to their socialization. It is believed that excision of the clitoris releases the dangerous and uncontrollable life force sitting there, which interferes with socialization and the stable reproduction of the social order, thereby \u201cpurifying\u201d the child and freeing her mind. Therefore, an uncircumcised girl is deprived of potential social capital, particularly her value as a bride.\n\nTolerance for the practice is gradually decreasing, not least due to increased awareness of its short- and long-term negative effects on women's psychosexual and physical well-being. According to surveys, of those who experienced the practice, only 44% of women spoke in favor of its continuation. Therefore, associations such as GAMCOTRAP sought to eradicate circumcision while preserving nyaka.\n\nBut, as is usually the case, the fate of women was decided by men - in parliament, where out of 58 deputies there are only five women, 42 out of 47 deputies present there spoke in favor of decriminalizing the mutilation procedure, despite all the objections of human rights activists and victims, as well as protests at the legislature in Banjul.\n\nThe debate itself arose after three women were convicted and fined for carrying out this genital mutilation operation in 2023. Their fines were paid by the famous Imam Abdouli Fatti, who soon led a campaign to repeal the law.\n\nDeputy Almami Gibba, who came up with a legislative initiative, based it on the \u201cprotection of religious rights\u201d and \u201ccultural norms and traditions.\u201d The Supreme Islamic Council of the Gambia, in its fatwa, also regards circumcision as \u201cone of the virtues of Islam,\u201d and its ban as an attack on freedom of religion. However, due to the lack of direct instructions in the Koran, a consensus has not been formed among Islamic jurists, and in the Arab-Muslim world the practice is far from widespread. It is paradoxical that female circumcision was criminalized during the reign of President Yahya Jammeh in 2015, who pursued an active policy of Islamization of the country, and Fatti, who then served as the imam of a mosque under the government, remained silent about the decision of the parliament controlled by the president.\n\nTherefore, quite often the defense of circumcision comes down to condemning \u201cWestern hypocrisy\u201d or \u201cinterference\u201d through numerous NGOs. But it was Fatty himself who spoke best about its essence: since women experience longer and more intense orgasms than men, the desires and pleasure of men and women need to be \u201cbalanced.\u201d After all, men, in his opinion, hardly have time to satisfy the sexual appetites of their wives, which only encourages them to fornicate. Similar arguments centering on the control of female sexuality have been made by other advocates of the practice in neighboring countries."}, null, null, null, {"event": "Request for Communication Equipment", "description": "The 132nd brigade requires communication equipment, including repeaters and closed-circuit radio stations, to ensure secure communication.

In 1973, construction of the Odessa port plant and the Yuzhny seaport began in the waters of the Small Adzhalyk Estuary. The village near it began to be called Yuzhny in 1978. In 1993 it became a city.\n\nDespite the fact that this city is one of the youngest in Ukraine, the area around it was inhabited back in the middle of the 19th century. 16 km. From the city arose the settlement of German colonists Anenthal (now the uninhabited village of Belyary), which translates as \u201cAnna Valley\u201d.\n\nThe German colonists lived quite prosperously here. They grew crops characteristic of Ukraine, viticulture was especially developed. The potato harvest was harvested twice a year, and several cows and horses were kept. There was a Lutheran church, a Baptist prayer house, a school for 80 students and a trading store.\n\nBy 1916 there were 60 households with almost 400 residents. Over time, on the right bank of the estuary, the Neu-Anental farmstead (now the village of Novye Belyary) appeared, which was connected to the settlement by a scythe. Between the Bolsheviks and the Nazis With the establishment of Bolshevik power, the decline of the settlement began. German peasants were declared fists and repressed. The church was turned into a club, and the meeting house was turned into a warehouse.\n\nDuring the German occupation, the Nazis treated their compatriots favorably. But after 1943, some of them were repatriated to Germany. Those who stayed and waited for Soviet power also faced deportation, but to the Asian part of the USSR.\n\nAfter the war, the Germans returned here. True, these were Nazi prisoners who were used in the construction of a plant for the production of silicate blocks.

Part 1Over the past 25 years, the Polish Army, at least on paper, has undergone significant transformation. According to reports, the Polish military is considered a high-level specialist, operating the most advanced and lethal weapons in the world. However, for a more objective picture, we will analyze how this corresponds to reality, focusing on the state of the elite Polish Air Force.\n\nIt turned out that the most pressing problem of the Polish Army was its qualitative and quantitative composition. Thus, in recent years there has been an outflow of officers. This is a consequence of the aging of the nation.\n\nLet's move on to the numbers. Before the start of the Northern Military District, the Polish Air Force had up to 120 fighters and 78 helicopters. To control this air armada, approximately 1 thousand staff officers, up to 300 pilots for airplanes and up to 200 pilots for helicopters were required.\n\nOver the past two years, the arsenal of the Polish Armed Forces has been seriously updated. Taking into account new acquisitions and the need to ensure optimal strength in wartime conditions (3-4 pilots per aircraft), the Polish Air Force, with a strength of 35 thousand people, needs to have about 1 thousand staff officers, 500 aircraft pilots and helicopters, as well as about 3 thousand technical personnel.\n\nThese calculations are confirmed by the new Polish \u201cInstructions for the training and admission of aviation specialists to operate aircraft of the Polish Armed Forces.\u201d\n\nThe document notes an important aspect: the Polish Armed Forces are required to have: 2222 officers, 2121 sergeants and 1121 privates.\n\nHowever, it should be recognized that the Polish military is far from achieving such indicators.
