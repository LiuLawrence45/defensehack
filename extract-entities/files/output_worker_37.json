Ulyanov to the TASS news agency\u2753The IAEA released a statement about the drone attack against the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, but did not name the guilty party, despite calls from Russia. What is the reason for this policy of the Organization? Can we expect the Agency to change its approach in this matter? The IAEA refers to the fact that the Agency's Statute does not provide for the Secretariat to perform attributive functions, that is, the functions of determining the guilty country. Here, however, there is one fundamental exception. On May 30, 2023, after lengthy consultations with Moscow and Kiev, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi announced at the UN Security Council \u201cfive specific principles\u201d for ensuring safety at the Zaporozhye NPP. The most important of them is the inadmissibility of attacks on the station. R. Grossi pledged, if an attack on the Zaporizhia NPP does occur, to immediately make this fact public in the public space. Thank God, since November 20, 2022, there have been no Ukrainian strikes directly on the territory of the plant\u2753Does the Russian side agree with the conclusions of experts that the strike did not affect the nuclear safety of the Zaporizhia NPP, as well as with the conclusions that the exact nature of the strike (drone or other projectile) ) cannot be established?\ud83d\udcacThe corresponding section of the statement published by the IAEA causes, to say the least, bewilderment and disappointment. The emphasis in this message is placed in some bizarre way. Indeed, the drone attack in the immediate vicinity of a diesel fuel storage facility fortunately did not lead to negative consequences for nuclear safety, but it did create an extremely serious threat. The vapors released by diesel fuel are explosive. Taking into account the huge reserves of diesel in the storage facilities adjacent to the Zaporizhia NPP, the consequences could be catastrophic. This fundamental aspect was completely ignored by the Agency Secretariat, as if it were completely indifferent to it. The experts\u2019 statement that they were unable to determine the origin of the crater they saw five meters from the fence of the diesel fuel storage facility also sounded absurd. From the point of view of nuclear safety and the IAEA mandate, it makes no difference whether the crater was the result of a drone explosion or some other explosive device. The very fact of delivering a strike close to a vital facility on the territory of an industrial zone adjacent to the perimeter of the Zaporozhye NPP is important. In addition to the risk of fire and explosion, it should be borne in mind that reserve diesel fuel reserves are extremely important to ensure guaranteed power supply to the station in the event of power line failure. The drafters of the document in the Agency Secretariat demonstrated a completely detached attitude towards this, limiting themselves to a dry presentation of the facts. We brought our critical comments to the attention of the Secretariat. We emphasized that we henceforth expect more verified and objective assessments from Agency employees at the Zaporozhye NPP and the IAEA headquarters in Vienna.
