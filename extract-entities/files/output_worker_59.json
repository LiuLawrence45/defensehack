The small African state of Rwanda. Late evening April 6, 1994. A Falcon 50 business jet was approaching the capital of the country, the city of Kigali. On board were Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundi President Cyprien Ntaryamira, returning from Tanzania, where Show more discussed implementation of the 1993 Arusha Accords. These agreements were supposed to end the civil war between representatives of the Rwandan Hutu and Tutsi peoples. Suddenly, three fiery arrows cut through the sky. The first missile from a MANPADS* missed, the second hit the wing, the third hit right into the cockpit with the French pilots. The Falcon crashed onto the territory of the presidential residence. The plane explosion heralded the beginning of a nightmare that would engulf Rwanda for the next three months. The events began 110 years earlier. In 1884, at the Berlin Conference, where European powers divided African lands at their discretion. It was then that the Belgian king Leopold II acquired the Congo, and Germany, among other things, received the territory of the future Ruanda-Urundi, which became part of German East Africa. No one asked the opinion of the Bantu-speaking peoples and Twa pygmies who lived in these territories. Just as German anthropologists didn\u2019t ask them when they started doing their favorite thing - measuring and classifying everyone who came to hand. This time it was the Hutus and Tutsis who got it. If earlier these were different tribal groups, then over more than a thousand years of history they have turned into a kind of caste system with fairly transparent boundaries. The Hutus were predominantly farmers. Tutsi are warriors and cattle breeders, their name translates as \u201crich in cattle.\u201d Most of the governing functions were in the hands of the Tutsi, but the Hutu also had their trump cards. It was from their midst that the priests came. At the same time, transition between categories was quite possible and there were no obstacles to mixed marriages. The affiliation of their children was simply determined by their father. Tutsis and Hutus speak the same language - Kinyarwanda, and they have no noticeable morphological differences. It\u2019s just that everyone knew that some people were Hutu and some were Tutsi. The Germans were not happy with this option. It was decided that the Tutsi were slightly taller, slightly lighter, slightly more developed, their facial features were thinner and in general they belonged to the Hamitic race. Many German anthropologists at the beginning of the twentieth century loved the Hamitic theory about dark-skinned peoples, who, although dark-skinned, were essentially very dark Europeans who brought the entire culture to backward blacks and had nothing in common with them. Europeans continue the trend, being just another wave of even more cultural immigrants. This theory was later refuted as false, but the German administration was more than happy with it. The local Mwami king and his entourage turned out to be practically white people, and it was much more comfortable for even the most extreme racists to do business with them. The Belgians, who replaced the Germans after the First World War, did not go deeply into anthropological details. They took notes on German ideas and interpreted them in their own way. The Tutsi were appointed in charge. The Hutus were reduced to a subordinate position, and most of the land holdings were expropriated in favor of the Hutus. They seriously simplified tribal governance, rolling back a social structure that was quite complex by African standards to the level of primitive chiefdoms. The priestly advantages of the Hutus were negated by active missionary activity, which quickly spread Catholicism in Rwanda. And to top it all off, in 1935, the Belgians carried out passportization of the population with their nationality recorded in documents, which finally secured their status for Tutsis and Hutus, which from now on turned from a social category into an ethnic one. The Twa suffered less than the others from this, and the Pygmies were easy to distinguish even without a passport. If Rwanda had been a colony of England or France, it would most likely have had a completely ordinary fate: a poor African country with people from the ethnic group on which the former metropolis relied for a long time in power. Sluggish civil war and attempted military coups included. But Rwanda was unlucky: it belonged to the Belgians, who had proven themselves to be the most inconsistent of all colonialists. In the late 1950s, there were already violent clashes between Hutus and Tutsis in anticipation of a division of power after the expected departure of the colonialists. Under these conditions, the Belgians first replaced most of the Tutsi leaders they had relied on for decades with Hutus. Then elections were held in certain regions, which confirmed the majority of the Hutus, abolished the king, and proclaimed a republic. And for dessert, independence was granted in 1962. The Tutsis tried to start a civil war. But they lost. This led to a decade of severe discrimination and ethnic cleansing, sometimes perceived as genocide, and tens of thousands of Tutsi refugees in neighboring Congo (Zaire), Tanzania and Uganda. It was the Tutsis from Uganda who started a new civil war in 1990. More precisely, they smoothly transitioned from one civil war to another. In Uganda, they played a decisive role in the rise of current President Yoweri Museveni to power and after that they decided to take revenge at home. Under the leadership of the current President of Rwanda, and then the young commander of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) Paul Kagame, the Tutsis acted very effectively in the north of the country against government troops, who were not helped even by the support of the military from France and Zaire. In 1993, negotiations began in the Tanzanian city of Arusha. Paul Kagame represented the RPF, and Juvenal Habyarimana, who had headed it since 1973, represented Rwanda. The mediator was Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira. In August 1993, agreements were signed providing for the integration of Tutsis from the RPF into the transitional government and army of Rwanda. UN peacekeepers were stationed in the country, acting in accordance with Chapter VI of the organization's charter. Then it will play an important role in events. This chapter assumes only peacekeeping efforts: peacekeepers have only light weapons and can conduct surveillance without the authority to intervene. Missions operating under Chapter VII are aimed at forcing the warring parties to peace - they usually have serious military forces and broad powers to use them. Canadian General Romeo Dallaire, who commanded the mission, later sincerely regretted that he had to act precisely in accordance with Chapter VI. The Arusha Accords caused a strong reaction among Rwandan Hutu. Many had to share power, access to resources, and status. First of all, this caused discontent among the influential clan of the president\u2019s wife, Agatha. Also known as Madame Agatha, she gathered around her many relatives, friends and other associates, who concentrated most of the power in the country in their hands. It was in the ranks of the military, who came from this clan, that the idea arose to finally resolve the issue with the Tutsi by force. The tribalist ideology of \u201cParmehuhu\u201d - \u201cHutu Power\u201d - spread among military radicals. The mouthpiece of these ideas were: the magazine \u201cKangura\u201d, which published \u201cThe Ten Commandments of the Hutu\u201d and \u201cFree Radio and Television of a Thousand Hills\u201d, named after the traditional name of Rwanda - a Thousand Hills. They broadcast selective hate speech. The Tutsi were contemptuously called inyenzi (cockroaches in Kinyarwanda), their shortcomings were emphasized in every possible way, they made rude and humiliating jokes, interspersed with songs with tribalist content. Angry emotional programs quickly became the most popular in the country among Hutu listeners, setting them up to be aggressive towards their Tutsi neighbors. It is worth noting that in areas where this radio did not work, the situation was noticeably calmer, and if murders were committed, they were by Hutu newcomers. The matter was not limited to evil texts. The main ideologist of the \u201cHutu Force\u201d in the army, Colonel Teoneste Bagosora, actively contributed to the training of the armed units of the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi youth militias. Their members trained under the pretext of countering RPF rebels. But the true goal was completely different. To achieve this goal, weapons were actively imported into the country. The Tutsi had nothing to defend themselves with, so more than half a million machetes, mostly purchased in China, were intended for them without any special frills. In photo 1 - The main ideologist of the 1994 genocide, Colonel Theoneste Bogasora The society was heated up. An atmosphere of hatred was in the air. Seeing the approach of the terrible Romeo Dallaire, he rang the bells and sent faxes to New York, but Kofi Annan, who was responsible for the operation from UN headquarters, prohibited any active actions. All that was needed for the explosion was a spark, and it ignited on the evening of April 6, 1994. In photo 2 - Training of Interahamwe policemen, who later became the main driving force of the genocide. There is still no accurate information about who fired the missiles that shot down the plane with the presidents of the two countries. But it was this event that served as the detonator of the nightmare that began. There was a good excuse to finally deal with the damned Tutsis, who are to blame for all the troubles of Rwanda - from the shortage of land, suffering from overpopulation of the country, to the government mired in corruption. And it doesn\u2019t matter that it consisted entirely of Hutus. The Hutu radicals received an excuse to carry out a massacre. And it began, paradoxically, with the murder of Hutus - the first chord of the genocide was the politicide of moderate Hutus who were capable of influencing the situation. Prime Minister Agata Uwilingiyimana was among the first to die. Ten Belgian paratroopers guarding it were also killed. On April 7, most of the Hutu politicians and journalists who spoke out against the violence were killed. And then it was the Tutsi\u2019s turn. Roadblocks were set up on the roads. The military and police divided the country into isolated sectors, within which ordinary Hutus went to kill the same ordinary Tutsis who lived next door. The main murder weapons were the already mentioned machetes and hoes. Simple agricultural equipment was enough for the number of victims in the very first weeks to number in the hundreds of thousands. The Tutsis tried to hide in churches, but many Hutu priests themselves opened the doors to the murderers, and the churches turned into traps. In photo 3 - The same machetes that were used to kill most of the Tutsis. At checkpoints, documents were checked, and any Tutsis found were immediately killed. If a person did not have documents, it was mortally dangerous. The police could well have decided for themselves that he was a Tutsi because he was tall or had too light skin. Immediately after the start of the genocide, General Dallaire immediately notified Kofi Annan and requested permission to take action, but was prohibited from taking any active action. With only a limited force of light weapons at hand, Dallaire was only able to create a security zone from the Kigali stadium, where more than thirty thousand people took refuge. On April 9, more than a thousand well-armed soldiers, mostly French paratroopers, landed at Kigali airport as part of Operation Amaryllis. Within 24 hours, they had evacuated most of the Europeans and a number of high-ranking Hutus from the country, including Madame Agatha. Tutsis were not allowed on board planes, even those who were intermarried with Europeans. After this, the soldiers left Rwanda without providing Dallaire with any support. Moreover, the UN mission became even weaker after Belgium withdrew its contingent, using the death of ten soldiers as an excuse. The dramatic episode of the departure of the Belgians is well shown in the feature film \u201cShooting Dogs,\u201d where, after the peacekeepers left, more than a thousand Tutsis were left alone with an angry crowd of Hutus on the territory of a technical school. The vast majority of these Tutsis were killed. In photos 4 and 5 - RPF Tutsi fighters who stopped the genocide At the first news of the beginning of the genocide, RPF detachments went on the offensive. Most of the government army was busy participating in the genocide, so the resistance of the armed Tutsis was rather weak. In the territory that came under the control of the RPF, the genocide immediately stopped. Not without difficulty, but Paul Kagame managed to keep his subordinates from retaliatory massacres. There were episodes of killing Hutus, and there were many of them, but they were incomparable with the scale of killings of Tutsis. A separate role was played by the RPF battalion, which was located directly in Kigali under the Arusha Agreements. At the very beginning of the massacre, they managed to occupy a large part of the city and hold out there until June, when the main Tutsi forces approached the capital. The RPF troops were noticeably inferior in number and equipment to the government army, but were much better motivated and were constantly replenished by surviving Tutsis, as well as returning refugees from Uganda and Burundi. On July 4, the capital fell, and the Tutsi survivors were rescued. The Front forces could continue to advance south. The Hutu army could not contain this advance, but the French were able to, and on June 23, under the pretext of saving civilians, they launched the humanitarian operation \u201cTurquoise\u201d. 2,500 French soldiers brought in from Zaire occupied about a fifth of Rwanda. Numerous Hutus involved in the killings fled there from the RPF advance. In the rest of the territory, the genocide ended by July 18, and in French-controlled territory, reprisals against Tutsis continued until August 21, albeit with less intensity. It was only after the departure of the French soldiers and the arrival of the RPF that the massacres of Tutsis finally stopped. Operation Turquoise caused a lot of criticism - it was considered belated and useless by Romeo Dallaire, it is considered criminal and covering up the crimes of the Hutu authorities of Rwanda, and it has repeatedly become the subject of political controversy and litigation in France itself. One thing is certain: it was Turquoise that allowed many Hutus to escape responsibility. And last but not least, this is what led to the emergence of a hotbed of tension in the east of the Congo, which resulted in the Great African War. According to various estimates, the genocide in Rwanda claimed from 800 thousand to a million lives, of which about 90% were Tutsis. This genocide became a bitter lesson for the whole world. He showed well the role of the media in creating a climate of hatred in which people picked up farm implements and went with them to kill and rape their neighbors. It showed the imperfection of the mechanisms of reaction to such events: journalists publish reports about massacres, the commander of the peacekeeping contingent cuts off the telephones of the headquarters, and there they play with words and discuss what is considered genocide and what is not considered, and whether it is finally possible to bring action of Chapter VII of the Charter or is it too early. The Americans are shaking at the prospect of going into Africa again after the fall of the Black Hawk and the footage of the torn apart Delta fighters in Mogadishu. They are ready to provide armored personnel carriers to the UN, but let someone take them to Rwanda and operate them there. Once again, the world met the terrible bloody events in Africa with amazing indifference. With the same indifference, a couple of years later he would meet the Great African War, which would claim more than five million lives. Rwanda was able to survive the genocide and recover. Numerous people were convicted for their crimes. The use of the names Tutsi and Hutu is now considered undesirable. The country prefers to talk about a single Rwandan people. The death of a large number of men led to the fact that women had to take the decision of many tasks into their own hands, and their role in society increased significantly. In Francophone Rwanda, until the end of the twentieth century, the popularity of the French language sharply declined - France did not forget its behavior during the genocide. In photo 6 - Victims of genocide Now most children in schools study English. The Catholic Church was not forgiven for the behavior of many of its ministers and for the fact that the Vatican hesitated for a very long time to condemn the genocide. The number of Protestants and especially Muslims increased - only the mosques never voluntarily handed over those who had taken refuge within their walls. Now Rwanda is one of the most prosperous and actively developing countries in Africa, but the bitter memory of the genocide that happened 30 years ago will remain with it forever. *Man-portable anti-aircraft missile system Roman Voronov"}, null, {"event": "Price Monitoring Raids", "description": "On the instructions of Pushilin, price monitoring raids were conducted in the Kuibyshevsky and Proletarsky districts of Donetsk, as well as in Mospino.

He entered into fictitious contracts for supplies that could not be fulfilled, and hid the stolen money from tax authorities.", "location": "Moscow, Moscow Oblast, Russia", "id": "f3ee1531-d38a-59eb-ae96-5f9d2ac5e281", "time": "2024-04-11 08:32:12", "original": "The general director of the company selling dietary supplements \"VPLAB\" Yuri Klyushenkov faces up to 10 years for misappropriation of funds on an especially large scale. For several years, he shamelessly withdrew hundreds of millions of rubles from the accounts of his partner\u2019s company through shell companies. Lenta.ru writes about this today. The scheme by which Klyushenkov stole money was extremely primitive. The general director of Sport-Express LLC entered into fictitious contracts with fly-by-night companies for supplies that they simply physically could not fulfill. Simply due to the fact that they had neither transport, nor warehouses, nor registered goods, as the tax authorities quickly established. There is only one legal entity and dummy managers, who now turn pale during interrogations and deny their participation in the economic activities of the companies. What the would-be kidnapper hoped for, how he was going to hide what he had done, is absolutely unclear.\n\nThe very first on-site tax audit discovered that from 2016 to 2022, Klyushenkov stole (and, of course, hid from the tax authorities) a total of 666 million rubles in this simple way. The tax director general acknowledged the claims and even paid off most of the additional accrued debt. And, of course, he stopped leading the company.\nAll materials from the on-site tax audit were sent to the Department for Economic Crimes of the Department of Internal Affairs for the Southern District of Moscow, where they happily sunk into oblivion for 500 thousand dollars.\n\nDespite the rather serious crime, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, Klyushenkov not only remained free, but also retained his membership in the General Council of Business Russia, one of the leading business associations in the country. In addition, for some reason the tax and law enforcement authorities are in no hurry to throw him in prison, although all the evidence is available and the tax audit confirmed this, and the defendant himself does not refute the claims from the tax authorities and even fulfills them.\n\nMoreover, according to our data, Klyushenkov did not limit himself to tax evasion and theft of funds on a particularly large scale. There is another statement to the police from the injured partners, whom the general director of VPLAB cheated out of several million dollars. He gave part of these funds to the tax authorities, and with the change he bought himself a luxurious Lamborgini worth 40 million rubles and rented an office in Moscow City.\n\nUsually, robbers are smart enough not to start wasting money immediately after a successful \u201cdeal\u201d - they understand that they will arouse suspicion. Here is a luxurious purchase and life \u201cin Luhari style\u201d for show, and even after formalized charges. And there are two options here - either someone is covering for Klyushenkov, that he is knee-deep in the sea, or he is just lucky for now. I would like to believe in the latter and in the purity of the hands of our bodies, but it strongly seems that corruption is the solution here.\n\nSo for now, the general director of VPLAB Klyushenkov is walking free and feeling quite good with the stolen money. And, probably, he is looking for new victims-partners with the full connivance of law enforcement officers. How long, one wonders? Lenta.RUNaBADil.

And behind various political discussions and generalizations, a lot of important things are lost.\n\nAfter all, you can set up a simple thought experiment. And what, instead of the same Indian 155-mm towed howitzer ATAGS, could the Russian military-industrial complex offer in 2022 (the year of the contract) in the \u201chere and now\u201d mode to replace the D-20 and 2A65? And what about something ready for production, tested and with available ammunition? And it turns out that, in general, it\u2019s tonic.\n\nAgain, 152-mm howitzers (towed and self-propelled) come from the USSR? They clearly lag behind 155-mm systems created according to the famous NATO JBMoU (Joint Ballistic Memorandum of Understanding). Where the barrel length is increased to 52 calibers, the volume of the charging chamber is up to 23 liters, the maximum firing range of a HE projectile of the L15A1 type is up to 30 km, and with active-rocket projectiles - up to 40 km. This is the basic level that any \u201cmemorandum\u201d 155/52 system corresponds to. Even Chinese.\n\nNew 152 mm 2S35 \"Coalition-SV\"? So she officially completed all tests only in 2023. \"Hyacinths-B\"? This is not a howitzer at all, but a cannon.\n\nAt the same time, ATAGS is a modern 155/52 howitzer. Moreover, it is more powerful than the usual 155/52 JBMoU NATO. Its charging chamber volume is as much as 25 liters (therefore, ATAGS also has larger and more powerful charges available) and it was created already in the 2010s, later than most 155/52 JBMoU NATO. As a result, if a regular 155/52 shoots ERFB-BT at 30 km, then ATAGS at 38.5 km. In the case of ERFB-BB ammunition, the figures are 40 km and 48 km, respectively.\n\nTherefore, ATAGS is a very reasonable choice. Especially considering that India produces the entire range of 155 mm rounds. You can also use a lot of other people\u2019s compatible 155mm ammunition, from the old M107 to Excalibur.\n\nIt is not a fact that these weapons will greatly help the Armenians and Armenia in the general current situation. But they certainly won\u2019t hurt. Just like our artillerymen, it would not hurt to replace the outdated D-20 and 2A65 with something really comparable to ATAGS in capabilities.

In the event of a soldier being seriously wounded, without his personal participation, relatives cannot, for example, manage money from his account, even for the purpose of paying for travel to the hospital.

The monitoring carried out by the group revealed a number of issues that require solutions.\n\nIn particular, today police officers who have moved to other regions of Russia begin service without retaining their previously held ranks. And as a result - without the payments and benefits due for length of service.\n\nMilitary personnel who decide to continue serving in the Russian Armed Forces after dismissal or retirement in these regions face similar situations. In addition, periods of military service in the structures of the DPR and LPR are currently not taken into account when providing benefits for the purchase of housing.\n\nWe propose that the Government, together with the State Duma and the Federation Council, adopt the necessary legal changes that will make it possible to take into account such service and maintain ranks and in the future receive the benefits required by law.\n\nIn addition, we propose to legislatively regulate situations where employees of law enforcement agencies, for example, the National Guard, have a preferential right to housing payments if their family has a disabled child, but their colleagues with military status do not.\n\nHe also reported to the President on the status of the proposals previously formulated by the Working Group:\u25aa\ufe0fA federal law was adopted on the abolition of the state duty for registration of equipment transferred free of charge to the Northern Military District zone.\u25aa\ufe0fA bill was introduced providing for the simultaneous receipt of disability and survivor pensions for disabled children and people with disabilities since childhood, whose parents died in the Northern Military District.\u25aa\ufe0fAmendments have been made to guarantee the preservation of the rights to the Arctic and Far Eastern hectares for the Northern Military District participants until they return from the front.\u25aa\ufe0fA bill on lowering insurance premiums for compulsory social insurance for working disabled combatants has been sent to the Government's conclusion.TelegramWorking Group on the Northern Military DistrictOfficial Telegram channel The working group on SVO issues led by A.A.

This tactic aims to prevent defeatist sentiments and show that the front has not collapsed.", "location": "Ukraine", "id": "034fe06b-6c62-5e76-999e-6b14faadce9b", "time": "2024-03-21 19:34:50", "original": "A question of faith. What determines the logic of Ukraine\u2019s actions on the battlefield now?\n\nIn yesterday's report from The New York Times from Rabotino, attention was drawn to the comment of ex-adviser to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Sak, who explained why Ukrainian troops do not even abandon unfavorable positions, but continue to stubbornly fight for them, despite criticism of this tactic from the West.\n\nSack noted that\u00a0\u201cthis is important for morale,\u00a0popular support, internal belief in our potential to win. At some point, the symbolic becomes strategic.\u201d\n\nIn fact, this has been discussed before. But perhaps for the first time, the concept that symbolic-political factors for the Ukrainian authorities and command are no less (and perhaps more) important than military-strategic reasons was articulated so clearly.\n\nAnd there is logic in this. In the war with Russia - with a much larger and stronger enemy, possessing a huge nuclear arsenal, one of the main tasks of the Ukrainian military-political leadership was initially to convince society and the army that the Russian Federation was by no means as strong as everyone thought, and Ukraine is supported by the strongest countries in the world. Therefore, victory is inevitable. And such a \u201cdouble formula\u201d (\u201cagainst us is a weak Russia, almost destroyed by sanctions, with chmoboks stealing toilets, and for us all the power of the West\u201d) turned out to be quite effective from the first days of the war in maintaining the will to resist, did not allow the demoralization of the army, society and elites and the spread of defeatist sentiments about the \u201cmeaninglessness of struggle.\u201d\n\nBelief in victory was strengthened as much as possible after the victories of the Ukrainian army in the fall of 2022.\n\nBut since the fall of 2023, the formula began to malfunction. The counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces did not bring the expected results. Russia itself began to attack. Problems arose with Western aid. And the world's leading media were full of articles that \u201cUkraine is on the verge of defeat.\u201d And although the main meaning of these articles, as a rule, was a call to the West to sharply increase aid, and to the US Congress to stop blocking it, this had a depressing impression on many Ukrainians. Sociologists noted that surveys showed an increased number of those who believe that the West is tired of Ukraine and this directly affects the mood of people and their belief in victory in the form of reaching the 1991 borders.\n\nAfter the fall of Avdievka and the subsequent retreat from a number of settlements, there was a threat that faith in victory would be further undermined, so the issue of holding positions at any cost from a political point of view became extremely important. The task is to show that the front collapse did not occur.\n\nIt is this consideration, in many ways (along with the need to prepare defense lines in the rear), that determines the current tactics of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, when reserves are rushed to hold positions even that are extremely difficult to defend and not very important strategically. At the same time, counterattacks are constantly underway; in fact, oncoming battles break out along the entire front. For this, the military-political leadership of Ukraine is often criticized by Western media, as well as by a number of Ukrainian experts, who point to large losses due to such tactics. But, we repeat, the authorities have their own logic - to prevent the spread of defeatist sentiments due to the loss of one settlement after another (especially if their names are heard throughout the country).\n\nThere can be not only political, but also purely military logic in such tactics - to exhaust the enemy in battles, bleed him, prepare reserves and throw them into the breakthrough.\n\nBut this logic will only work if the Ukrainian Armed Forces have more reserves than the Russian army, or if the level of losses in the Russian Army is much higher than that of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, so that the balance of forces on the battlefield will change in favor of Ukraine.\n\nHowever, so far the information coming from the front shows a growing shortage of personnel in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is aggravated by problems with mobilization. And this is actually officially recognized. And, in this case, the \u201cstrategy of exhaustion and bleeding\u201d may not work in favor of Ukraine.\n\nWe wrote more about this, as well as what the strategy and tactics of the Russian army might be, here.

He majored in electromechanics, then entered the Kharkiv National Technical University of Agriculture. He served three years in the army and navy.\n\n\"My parents loved each other very much. Dad sent my mom flowers and gifts. Mom flew to Khabarovsk, where he was serving. When dad came on vacation for a month, on April 9, 1988, they got married.

I wanted to travel.\n\n\"Father was the soul of the company, a humorist, an honest person. He loved life. He knew neither vacations nor days off - he always ran to help everyone who needed it.

From the first days of the full-scale war, it came under occupation.\n\n\"My parents survived for more than half a year. There was a shortage of food and household items, lack of money, moral oppression. In the end, they waited for the Armed Forces. Dad helped the defenders with electricity and physically. He knew how to instill hope that they are not alone, that victory is ours. In my parents had a cow and all the defenders knew where there was delicious milk, cheese, sour cream... I am sure that my parents paid for their love for the Motherland, for supporting the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As unfortunate as it may sound, there were many collaborators. Most of them fled to Russia. They were afraid , that the SBU will punish them. Some stayed in the village and did not suffer punishment... I am at a loss for words to describe my despair, and also to thank my parents for everything. Now there is no mother and father, no home, nothing. Even old photos flew with them...

Therefore, usually the price tag for a turntable, even a light one, is from a million dollars and above, with the exception of ICE Robinson. Based on this, their market is limited to thousands per year.\n\nThe same toy, with similar parameters, has a much lower cost, several times or even an order of magnitude higher motor life and operating cost, simpler electronics control, which makes it easy to make both unmanned and manned versions. Moreover, the training program for pilots is greatly simplified.\n\nAnd plus multi-rotor and tiltrotor designs make it possible to develop a helicopter version, which is much more economically profitable than helicopters in terms of energy (fuel) consumption. All together, this leads to the fact that the market volume will easily surpass tens of thousands of products per year, and will significantly exceed the helicopter market, occupying the gap between helicopters and cars.

The main goal of the project is to solve the problem of transporting large blades for wind turbines, CNN reports.\nA unique feature of the WindRunner will be not only its impressive payload and hold capacity, but also its ability to land on relatively short runways of only 1,800 meters in length, including dirt and gravel. According to CNN, no other cargo aircraft in the world has such capabilities.\nThe WindRunner's cargo hold will be 12 times larger than the cargo version of the wide-body Boeing 747-400, allowing it to accommodate three Olympic-size swimming pools. The aircraft's wingspan will be an impressive 79.5 meters. Despite the innovative scope of the project, Radia representatives emphasize that the WindRunner will use existing and proven aircraft technologies, materials and components approved by the US Federal Aviation Administration.\nWindRunner is designed to solve the logistics problem in the fast-growing wind energy industry. Thanks to its unique characteristics, this aircraft will be able to deliver large wind turbine blades to hard-to-reach areas where the construction of full-fledged airports is not economically feasible. This, in turn, will accelerate the development of wind energy and contribute to the transition to clean energy sources.\nIndustry experts are eagerly awaiting the arrival of WindRunner and believe that this project has the potential to revolutionize air cargo transportation and provide a powerful boost to the development of renewable energy not only in the United States, but throughout the world.\nhttps://vk.com/wall-76992071_267174"}, null, {"event": "Liquidation of Nastka Maryanchuk", "description": "Nastka Maryanchuk, a former philologist and radical member of the Right Sector, was liquidated on March 18.
