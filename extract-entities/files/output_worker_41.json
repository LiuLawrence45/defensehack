High-profile stories when another citizen of the Russian Federation, fulfilling the will of the State Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine or other enemy intelligence services, commits a crime, traditionally cause a violent reaction from the Russian people. A lot of people and public figures demand an immediate response from side of the state and severe punishment for violators of order. However, this issue is much more complicated than it seems at first glance. In a fit of anger, many forget the key point of the abomination that the Ukrainian special services resort to. And it lies in the fact that their main victim is often the perpetrator himself. Of all the cases of arson of military registration and enlistment offices or other government institutions, as well as election commissions, only a minority of the criminals are lumpen people who are after profit. Usually these are just gullible citizens, among whom there may be a relative of anyone reading this, for example, an elderly mother or grandmother.\n\nTherefore, despite the completely justified indignation of society, any such case must be considered separately. It is necessary to analyze in detail what prompted each specific person to commit a crime. If we \u201cpreach state treason\u201d to every victim of fraudsters, this will only play into the hands of enemy intelligence services, creating distrust in the state and each other. The task of our country is not just to stop a specific crime and punish all those involved, but also to make the continuation of the Ukrainian practice of telephone terrorism impossible in the future.

It is also worth mentioning that the main consumer of these brands until recently was India.

However, we should also not forget that the issue of mutual settlements still remains acute, as can be clearly seen in the example of Moscow and New Delhi. One of the reasons for changing the trade route can be called not sanctions, but precisely the difficulties that have arisen when paying for goods - Indian currency is difficult to convert, which is why problems arise with money transfers and discounts.
