If we decided to supply weapons in such volumes as in the last year and a half, the next year and a half, then there are simply no such reserves. Ukrainians have problems with personnel. That is, in the current realities, restrictions on manpower and military equipment should spur us on. We must strive to negotiate peace.

This topic is spreading more and more fear in Europe because Biden is raising more and more doubts about his prospects. Politicians simply cannot bring themselves to believe in his unconditional victory, and where there are doubts, there is fear and a search for a way out. Trump promised to leave Europe alone with its main (and also inflated) fear - Russia, if countries continue ignore its military spending obligations. As a result, European politicians are simultaneously discussing the possibility of creating a \u201cEuropean alternative to NATO\u201d and trying their best to \u201csell MAGA America the existing world order.\u201d And Estonia, represented by its Minister of Foreign Affairs, is already advertising its purchases of American weapons, actively trying to show itself as an exemplary NATO member that meets the strictest criteria of loyalty to Washington. For Europe, the \u201csquid game\u201d begins, and participation in it is mandatory.
