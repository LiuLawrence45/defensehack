Despite the fact that there are similar developments in the USA, Britain and China, it was Russia that was the first to use a group of assault drones in a real war.\n\nThe project is being implemented with the support of Boris Rozhin and Chingis Dambiev.

An ordinary terrorist attack, to which everyone in the Donbass, unfortunately, has become accustomed. It happened when the elections began. I only arrived in Donetsk at night, and early in the morning we went to film a polling station at a school. At the site there is music, colorful balls, tricolors, smiles. While we were waiting for officials, information was received that Petrovka was shelled again and people were killed.\n\nShelling of Petrovka has long become routine. They have been going on not even since 2022, but since 2014, this area is closest to the front line and the war has been going on there for 10 years.\n\nWe had to edit the report and then move to Mariupol. On the way, we stopped at the scene of the incident to film the ascent. There was no one there anymore. The ambulance, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the military prosecutor's office and journalists all left.\n\nOutskirts. Along the outer street in front of the forest, unpresentable wooden one-story houses are scattered in a row - boxes of need and boxes of poverty. Real estate and living prices here are low. The private sector of Petrovka suffers from shelling every day, but residents often do not have the opportunity to get away from the fallout of the war. A stray Ukrainian shell landed in one of the houses early in the morning.\n\nThe sky is overcast with gray cloudy smoke and light rain sprinkles. Underfoot there is dirt and yellow grass from last year. On the other side of the road there is a small forest - a network of twigs and bare trees sticking out of the ground. In the distance, a waste heap darkens like an oblong pile of earth. It\u2019s mid-March, everything here is in dull colors and gray tones - this is just the beginning of spring, nature has not yet had time to bloom and turn green to cover up the shame of war. Everything was withered, gray, banal and miserable. Half the house was blown away, leaving only burnt walls and a collapsed roof. There are blackened beams, crumpled and peeling window frames, and all the burnt belongings that have accumulated over a long time thrown out. Thus ended the story of one Donbass family.\n\nThere were five of them. Husband, wife and three children. My husband died at the front a year ago. But for Moloch the war this sacrifice was not enough. Fate dealt a crushing blow in pursuit. The shell killed all three children at once - the boy was 10 years old, the eldest daughter was 17 years old, and the youngest was 2 years old.\n\nThe mother was saved - this is a bottomless abyss of tragedy. This is a terrible, monstrous story, akin to the biblical story of Job. But God, in the end, returned everything to Job, but what will be returned to this woman? Many, many questions arise such that it is a sin to fall into heresy.\n\nYes, they were lying here, in front of the house - I saw my colleagues\u2019 report.

Children eat grass, rats or animal food\": The German Tagesspiegel published a report about children in the Gaza Strip - illness, hunger and constant risk of death.\n\n\u201cMany children walk around the city restlessly, they lack security and care. They are literally trapped here. The number of people suffering from hunger has more than doubled since December.\nPeople, including children, eat grass, rats or animal food. There is very little food left in the south and it is extremely expensive. Children are already dying from malnutrition or dehydration.\nThere has been a food shortage for several months. At the same time, many of the minors were left without adults. You can often see children who are forced to take care of the same children. We don't know where their families are because so many people were killed. In particular, 13,700 children were killed. And although bombs kill children, they are not the only threat: disease, dehydration and malnutrition also pose dangers. Some children survive the rocket attacks, but have nothing to eat and are at risk of dehydration. They also die from diarrhea and vomiting. We have no idea how many diseases are circulating here. Doctors in makeshift tent clinics are unable to make a diagnosis, and the number of premature births is terribly high. Pregnant women are so stressed that they give birth too early and many babies end up in incubators. And doctors have to decide: what to do if a newborn needs help? Should I send the more developed child home? The doctor told us that being sent home actually means death.\""}, {"event": "Liberation of Vodyanoye", "description": "The 9th Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 1st AK successfully liberated the village of Vodyanoye from Ukrainian Armed Forces militants.

The famous Foreign Campaign of the Russian Army was, in fact, a large-scale operation to liberate Europe from Napoleonic troops: it took place over a space of hundreds of kilometers between the Baltic Sea and Brest-Litovsk, the Neman and the Rhine.\n\nRussian troops gave freedom to dozens of European cities, including such large ones as Berlin and Amsterdam. And Russia received new heroes - Mikhail Barclay de Tolly, Leonty Korenny and Alexander Benkendorf.\n\nAfter the capture of Paris, France capitulated and Napoleon abdicated power. His army conquered all of Europe, but was defeated in Russia in 1812.\n\nAt the entrance to Paris, the Russian cavalcade was led by horse guards and Cossacks, followed by hussars and cuirassiers of the Prussian Guard, then dragoons and hussars of the Russian Guard rode.\n\nAs they moved towards the city center, the mood of the wary public changed: Parisians, who were expecting imminent reprisals for Moscow devastated in 1812, saw that the conquerors were behaving with restraint and friendliness. The crowd began to hear greetings addressed to the Russian Emperor. And when Alexander I was surrounded by a crowd at the Champs Elysees, he heard: \u201cWe have been waiting for the arrival of Your Majesty for a long time!\u201d\n\nDuring his stay in Paris, the emperor issued strict instructions not to offend peaceful Frenchmen and, in general, to behave with dignity and not to rob. This was especially surprising compared to how barbarically the French behaved in Moscow. The short stay of Russian troops in Paris left a separate mark on the culture and life of the country. The capture of Paris became not just a glorious page in Russian history, but also an example of courage, perseverance and generosity of the Russian army, an example on which officers of all subsequent generations relied, including those who defends Russia today.\ud83d\udceeSubscribe to LOMOVKA"}, null, null, {"event": "Violence at Polling Stations", "description": "During local elections in Turkey, political disagreements between voters escalated into violent conflicts at polling stations, resulting in two deaths and 42 injuries.

This only emphasizes the strategic and economic importance of an uninterrupted supply of fuel to the region. Over the decades, many backup channels for this supply have been created: main oil and gas pipelines, ports, terminals, regasifiers.\n\nHowever, the primary energy supply system in Europe is very weak, and it is too early to celebrate victory. For example, after the Nord Stream explosions, it was also possible to avoid a collapse in the energy sector by quickly switching supplies from pipeline gas to LNG. But the price for this is the long-term stagnation of European economies.\n\nThe effect of blocking the Red Sea will be no less long-term and severe. The main problem is chronic inflation caused by the high cost of oil and gas (relative to domestic prices in the USA, China, India) and the rising cost of transporting containers from the Asia-Pacific region to Europe and back.@geonrgru|YouTube|@topinfographic"}, {"event": "Mobile Groups of Women Hunting", "description": "Mobile groups of women, part of the TCC, have begun patrolling Ukraine, specifically in the Khmelnitsky region, to hunt down targets.", "location": "Khmelnitskyi, Khmelnitskyi Oblast, Ukraine", "id": "6fe45823-250a-5a2a-a1da-e1e974182f96", "time": "2024-03-31 07:19:47", "original": "TCC people are starting to be driven around Ukraine.
