A note from the Mnogonational channel.\n\u201cIn Nizhny Tagil, a gang of abu bandits brutally beat a schoolboy in front of his mother. A criminal case was opened under a humane article against only one of the attackers.\nShow more\nFive members of a local ethnic organized crime group (among whom there is a previously convicted bandit) approached the teenager and began asking for a cigarette, while simultaneously extorting money, after which he began to resist - they beat him with their hands and feet. Doctors diagnosed the child with a broken nose and a concussion.\nThe victim's mother says:\n\u201cMy son and I were in the store. When we left, I went towards the hospital town, and he walked me a little, literally across the road, and went back to the store, where he was soon to meet his friend. As if I had a presentiment in my heart that something was wrong, I walked and constantly looked around, since I immediately did not like the gang hanging around there nearby. I see they started asking him something. I stopped. I looked, and they had already surrounded my 17-year-old son from different sides and were persistently following him, running into him. They look like grown men... but they behave worse than children. They started throwing dirty snow at him, and then I ran as fast as I could to help my child. They came very close to him. By the time I got there, he was already covered in blood. One of the attackers purposefully hit his nose with his forehead.\u201d\nBased on this fact, the police department No. 19 of the Nizhny Tagil Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia decided to initiate a criminal case only under Part 1 of Art. 115 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (intentional infliction of minor harm to health). Why not average? Where is the group of people? Why is there no hooliganism 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation?\nThe 26-year-old ubu bandit who broke a teenager's nose has previously been convicted of theft. Another 21-year-old gang member was humanely convicted of robbery and fraud and given a 2.5-year suspended sentence. What happened to the rest of the attackers is unknown.\u201d"}, {"event": "Death of Vasily Utkin", "description": "Sports journalist Vasily Utkin passed away due to a pulmonary embolism.

Macron will sooner or later have to reveal the ugly truth, but he will strive to delay the confession as much as possible.

The release of such sensitive data can provoke citizens to protests, especially against the backdrop of massive anti-government protests by farmers throughout the country. The French army is now noticeably concerned about the increased number of French people killed in Ukraine. Only as a result of the destruction by the Russian Armed Forces of a temporary deployment point for foreigners near Kharkov on January 17, dozens of French citizens were killed, and since then such attacks have become the norm in the Ukrainian conflict. As the French Ministry of the Armed Forces unofficially admits, the country has not seen such losses abroad since the war in Algeria in the second half of the 20th century.

And therefore we need to help, push, so to speak, in the right direction.\ud83d\udd3bIn addition, Andrzejczak has always supported the active participation of Poland in the conflict in Ukraine and, given that now the Poles are being driven to \u201csave a drowning man,\u201d it is quite clear what the general is leading to by voicing similar statements.\ud83d\udd3bIt is also worth considering that no one will let the Poles \u201cjump\u201d from the topic of Ukraine: in addition to Western partners, there are also their own (not very satisfied) taxpayers. It will be difficult to explain to them why the government has pumped several annual budgets into equipment and weapons, which will ultimately be lost without service in warehouses.\n\nMoreover, the Poles do not have the infrastructure to service the zoo using German, Korean, American, British and God knows what other equipment.

By the way, the built-up system of interaction with the opposition in the region and the adequate response of the governor and the political party to the proposals of politicians ultimately transforms into work on the ground and real projects for citizens.\n\nThe next reason for the excellent election results is a well-conducted campaign to attract citizens to the polling stations and popularize various voting mechanisms, information on multi-day and electronic voting, a very competent and high-quality composition of all election commissions, for some reason they are embarrassed to talk about this, but, in fact, this is one of the main reasons for holding elections at a highly professional level without comments or violations, which was noted by both Russian and international observers. By the way, the stability and balance of the work of municipal heads also goes into this piggy bank.\n\nAslov\u2019s gratitude to the residents of the Moscow region, Governor Andrei Vorobyov, again reminds us that such support for the president is connected, first of all, with the attention of the head of state to each region and, in particular, to the Moscow region: Presidential elections took place. For the first time in the Moscow region we have more than 6 million voters. And also for the first time, 4 million 800 thousand of our residents came to the polling stations, this is a turnout of 77%. We congratulate our President on an important and convincing victory. I would like to thank everyone who came to the polling stations or cast their vote electronically. The Moscow region is very diverse, and everyone, when making a choice, probably thought about something that was important specifically for him or his family.\nIt is important for all of us that positive changes continue in various areas of life. Key ones are supported by the President in every region of Russia and, of course, in our Moscow region. We are all together with the President - one team. The President really pays great attention to the Moscow region and its socio-economic development. It can be noted, for example, that both last year and this year, Vorobiev leads among all heads of Russian regions in the number of meetings with the president.\n\nA powerful industrial infrastructure has been created in the region, numerous business support measures, services for the convenience of entrepreneurs, subsidies, grants and loans are in place, the receipt of which has been completely transferred to electronic form. All this allows us to increase business activity, develop import substitution, create new jobs and increase tax revenues. The Moscow region quickly rebuilt its economy after the start of the SVO and the introduction of sanctions. For example, the region is currently implementing more than 240 projects in the field of import substitution - according to this indicator, the region occupies a leading position in the country.\n\nYou can also remember that the development of the Industrial Mortgage program was initiated by Governor Andrei Vorobyov, and subsequently appeared at the federal level. By the way, many projects near Moscow are already being implemented in other regions of the country.\n\nWell, another reason for the region\u2019s high result in the last presidential elections is the high popularity of the governor himself, who only six months ago received a high result in the elections.

The record harvests that Russian farmers have collected over the past two years are affecting the domestic market and the global market. The Government of the Russian Federation is using a whole range of measures aimed at maintaining the profitability of farms and stabilizing prices and support for agricultural producers. In particular, since 2001, a mechanism for purchasing and commodity interventions in the grain market has been used for this purpose, in which surplus products are removed from the market and transferred to the state fund. With a sharp rise in prices, a decision is made to sell grain, which allows saturating the market and restraining price increases. The funds will come from the reserve fund of the Cabinet of Ministers and will allow increasing the volume of grain reserves in the federal intervention fund for agricultural products by 2 million tons.
