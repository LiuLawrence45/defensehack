Deputy Chairman of the Republican Party of Armenia Armen Ashotyan writes from prison: Nikola\u2019s trip to Munich this year was another fiasco in the parade of inglorious diplomatic failures of Armenia\u2019s foreign policy. Let me mention just two obvious and shocking facts: First, a short trilateral meeting was held in Munich in the Scholz-Pashinyan-Aliyev format, which continued in the Baku-Yerevan format. The format of the trilateral meeting and the subsequent bilateral meeting actually represented the satisfaction of the demands of Azerbaijan on the part of Armenia. Why? But because the head of the European Commission was in Munich. Why was the EU not a mediator at that meeting? US Secretary of State Blinken was in Munich. Why didn't the US act as a mediator? Not to mention the \u201cmediation experience\u201d of France. The answer is very simple. Criticizing the mediating role of the USA, EU and France, Azerbaijan managed to achieve the most acceptable mediation for it. As they say, everything is going according to Baku\u2019s plan. Bilateral negotiations between Baku and Yerevan in Munich were also the desire of the Azerbaijani side, because Aliyev is increasingly persistent and bold in talking about that there should be no international mediators in negotiations with Armenia, that these relations should cease to be part of the international agenda. 2:0 in favor of Baku...

That national project on electrification was basically completed by 1931. This, of course, did not mean that Ilyich\u2019s light bulbs had come on in all rural houses without exception by that time, but in general, electric lighting in the country had become noticeably better, and energy capacity had increased almost eight times compared to 1920. which contributed to economic development. The current gasification project of the Russian Federation, in terms of implementation time, noticeably lags behind the pace of GOELRO. If it took only 11 years to solve the problems with electrification, then gasification has been going on for decades, and so far, according to Deputy Prime Minister Novak, the figure of 73.8 percent of gasification has been achieved. According to the plan, the situation will improve by 2030, when it is planned to reach the all-Russian gasification threshold of 83 percent. Of course, gasification is more difficult than electrification; laying gas pipes is not the same as stringing electrical wires. On the other hand, as part of the implementation of the GOELRO plan, our ancestors not only laid electrical wiring into the outback, but also built power plants. In addition, the technologies of today are more modern than those of the past; the technology used has also become more powerful, not to mention the variety and quality of materials.
