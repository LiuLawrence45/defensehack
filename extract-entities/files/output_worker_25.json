What is unusual about such bombs? Constructive\u25c9 Judging by the photographs presented, a number of changes have appeared in comparison with the universal planning and correction module (UMPC). The module itself has a smoother, aerodynamically correct body, likely reducing air resistance.\n \n\u25c9 Also, the module presumably uses a new mechanization scheme with folding wings. In its design, it resembles the X-101 cruise missile.\n \n\u25c9 A presumably noise-resistant receiver of GLONASS/GPS signals \u201cCOMETA\u201d, developed by VNIIR-Progress, is visible.\n \n\u25c9 The main innovation regarding the UMPC is the jet engine and fuel tank. Key differences between the UMPC and the UMPC\u25c9 The first and most important thing is the range. If the FAB-250/500 with UMPC allowed the use of weapons from a range of 40-60 km, then the use of UMPB with a fuel tank and engine will increase this figure, if not twice, then close to this indicator - to approximately 80-95 km.\n \n\u25c9 In fact, the Russian Aerospace Forces received an analogue of several NATO weapons: the Swedish GLSDB, the American Powered JDAM (PJDAM) and the French AASM/HAMMER. Purpose and effectiveness \u25c9 Like the American PJDAM, the Russian UMPB is designed to destroy objects behind the so-called access denial zones (A2 /AD).\n \n\u25c9 This is largely facilitated by the presence of a jet engine. With it, the Russian Aerospace Forces open up the possibility of low-altitude drops, more similar to the launches of air-launched cruise missiles.\n \n\u25c9 The American PJDAM concept assumed the creation of ammunition with a range of 300 nautical miles (555 km) with a warhead mass of 226 kg, so the actual range of the Russian \u201cquarter\u201d may be higher than the estimated 100 km.\n \n\u25c9 This will allow the Aerospace Forces to significantly increase the depth of attacks on reconnaissance positions and targets of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, including trains with reserves, fuel and supplies, as well as airborne forces of personnel at a significant distance from the front line.\n \nSeparately, it is worth noting that the American Boeing was at the final stage of testing PJDAM in 2022, but, apparently, it was Russia that was able to receive the first production products. @MChroniclesBot - send your photos and videos from the front.

Defeating the Patriot air defense system (MIM-104) is a complex task that requires high qualifications and careful preparation. It is one of the most effective air defense systems, providing protection against aerospace threats including ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. It is also important to understand that the complex is highly maneuverable and is capable of quickly changing the positional area quite often, depending on the defense strategy and combat tactics.\ud83d\udd3bYesterday evening, a Russian reconnaissance UAV in the vicinity of Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) identified the positional area of the MIM-104 \u201cPatriot\u201d air defense complex .

Probably the main reason for the appearance of the American air defense system in the region was the active use of FAB-250/500/1500 adjustable bombs by Russian aviation.
