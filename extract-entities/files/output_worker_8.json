Yakov Baklanov\u2019s military career began in 1824, when he was 15 years old. Baklanov continued the glorious family tradition - his father at that time commanded a Cossack hundred in the 1st Don Cossack Regiment. The young Cossack first distinguished himself in 1828-1829 in the war with the Turks, as a result of which he earned the rank of cornet.\n\nNature generously gifted Yakov Baklanov. Possessing a two-meter height and a heroic physique, he threw the enemy into confusion with just his appearance. Baklanov invariably rushed into the thick of the battle, waving a heavy saber, which the Ottomans nicknamed \u201cBatman-klych\u201d, which means \u201cpound sword\u201d. The Cossacks said that he could cut a person in half.\n\nHowever, Baklanov was distinguished not only by physical strength. His enemies considered him \u201cbewitched,\u201d although in fact he was not invulnerable. Baklanov repeatedly received wounds and concussions, but every time he returned to duty. The main secret of his victories was his unique personal philosophy. Baklanov's commitment to military affairs was rooted in deep religious feeling. This is how he himself described his military credo: \u201cFaith in God, stealth of movement, speed, then a bold blow to the first instinct of the heart.\u201d\n\nBaklanov fought for the longest time in the Caucasus. Superstitious mountaineers nicknamed the Russian hero Dajjal, the devil in the flesh.\nThe famous Dagestan shooter Dzhanem wanted to carry out one of the attempts to kill Yakov.\n\nHe boasted that he had special silver bullets prepared for \u201cBoklu-Shaitan\u201d.\n\nHaving learned that the highlander would be waiting for him in ambush, Baklanov pondered for some time whether it was worth going the usual way to the high mound, from where he regularly surveyed the area beyond the Michuk River. There was a battery (fortification) left by the Russians, and then the areas controlled by the highlanders began. The next morning, Baklanov went to the mound - as he himself admitted, out of \u201cboastfulness.\u201d Both his soldiers and the enemies on the opposite side watched closely what was happening. Suddenly a shot rang out from behind cover. But a miracle happened. Although Baklanov was a defenseless target at that moment, Janem missed. Having descended into the battery, the Dagestani reloaded his rifle and fired a second time. This time, it seems, the mountain \u201csniper\u201d lost his nerve - the bullet only pierced Baklanov\u2019s coat without causing him any harm.\n\n\u201cAt that moment I took my left leg out of the stirrup and placed it on the horse\u2019s mane; Leaning his left hand on his leg, he touched the nozzle, fired a shot, and my opponent flew backwards into the battery: the bullet hit his forehead and went right through,\u201d recalled Yakov Baklanov in his notes \u201cMy Combat Life.\u201d \u2013 The troops, standing silently, burst out \u201cHurray!\u201d, and the Chechens across the river jumped out from behind the rubble, in broken Russian mixed with their own, began to clap their hands: \u201cYakshy (good) Boklu! Well done Bocclou!\u201d\n\nSince then, Chechens have been repeating the saying \u201cDo you want to kill Baklanov?\u201d for many decades.

The decline is attributed to Iran stopping wheat imports from Russia, as well as issues with payment systems and logistics.", "location": "Tehran, Iran", "id": "3c6c3116-9b38-59a1-a317-9f6b07fe422e", "time": "2024-03-29 14:50:44", "original": "Why is trade between Iran and Russia declining? Wrote for Russian Forbes why trade turnover between Iran and Russia has fallen at the end of 2023. The general director of the Institute of Agricultural Market Studies, Dmitry Rylko, and the general director of the RusIranExpo group of companies, Alexander Sharov (@rusiranexpo22), helped to sort out the issue. Main points: \u25aa\ufe0fThe problem lies in Russian exports to the Islamic Republic. Trade between the two countries at the end of 2023 decreased by 17%, to $4 billion, but imports from Iran to Russia increased by 15.8%, to $1.29 billion. At the same time, Russian exports fell immediately by 27.1%, to $2. 7 billion, which led to the overall decline in trade indicators\u25aa\ufe0fThe decline is due to the fact that Iran stopped buying wheat from Russia in 2023. Tehran purchased 3\u20134 million tons of wheat from Russia, paying on average $200\u2013250 per ton, so it turns out that exports dropped by almost $1 billion\u25aa\ufe0fThere are two reasons: 1. Good grain harvest in Iran 2. Non-transparent import schemes to the Islamic republic: it is possible that wheat did arrive from Russia to Iran through third countries and intermediaries, it\u2019s just not reflected in the reporting\u25aa\ufe0fHowever, in general, the problems are much broader. The turning point year 2022, with a mass of visits to Tehran from Russia and loud statements about the development of cooperation, did not lead to the emergence of new categories of Russian goods on the Iranian market and did not change the structure of exports from Russia - the trade turnover still consists of 80% of grains with unstable wheat .\u25aa\ufe0fThe key problem has not been resolved: the lack of an effective payment system for trading operations. Formally, transfer systems from Russia to Iran exist, but they are guided by the state exchange rate (in Iran there are two rates: market and state). As a result, with each transfer, a Russian businessman loses 20\u201325%. At such rates, carrying cash turns out to be more profitable than transfers \u25aa\ufe0fLogistics remains another problem. If you transport goods to Iran through the Black Sea, you need to find a fleet that has nothing to do with Europe or the United States. If delivered through the Caspian Sea, then there are few ships, they are small-tonnage. Ground transport works poorly due to the lack of direct railway communication, there is a route through Central Asia, but the problem is the Kazakh transit rates\u25aa\ufe0f At the same time, Tehran, on the contrary, is having success: Iranian goods are expanding their presence in the Russian market. For the second year in a row, the volume of imports from Iran has been growing: in 2021 it amounted to $978 million, and in 2023 - $1.29 billion.\u25aa\ufe0fFood still makes up more than 50% of Iranian imports, but the share of other goods is gradually increasing: chemicals, industrial materials, spare parts and building materials, porcelain stoneware, catalysts, spare parts for turbines. In other words, trade turnover between the two countries is gradually becoming more balanced due to the growth of Iranian imports, and non-raw materials.\n\nFull article: https://www.forbes.ru/mneniya/509074-uzkij-koridor-pocemu-sokrasaetsa-torgovla-mezdu-iranom-i-rossiej@irandezhurniyForbes.ru Narrow corridor: why trade between Iran and Russia is declining Despite all the talk on strategic partnership, trade turnover between Iran and Russia at the end of 2023 decreased significantly.

Additionally, the Kh-101's stealth design and advanced navigation system make it more effective at breaking through enemy air defense.", "location": "Northern Military District, Russia", "id": "40f14411-35ad-591b-9adf-527a700d8f51", "time": "2024-03-29 19:16:31", "original": "You can\u2019t fool physics: or why the Kh-101 missile replaced the \u201cCaliber\u201d... We noticed that if at the beginning of the Northern Military District our main cruise missile was the \u201cCaliber\u201d launched from ships, today they have completely given way to the air-launched Kh-101 missile . And not by chance. The main limiting factor in the production of both missiles is the engine (both have a turbofan-50 engine). But the \"Caliber\" must fit into the standard 533-mm torpedo tube of the submarine, and hence its dimensions, which are somewhat smaller than those of X-101 (diameter 742 mm). And this is a lower flight weight (1770 kg versus 2300 kg). Moreover, in order for the rocket to stay in the air, the X-101 has a longer wingspan than the \"Caliber\" (4 meters versus 3.1 meters, respectively). An important argument is the air launch of the X-101, which means that fuel is not wasted on the initial acceleration of the rocket.\n\nAs a result, the Caliber has only 560 kg of fuel on board, and the X-101 has 1250 kg (in the basic version). And therefore it turns out that almost the same type of missiles (with approximately the same warhead power of 400 kg) have fundamentally different flight ranges (5,500 km for the Kh-101 and 2,000-2,500 km for the Caliber). The third important parameter is stealth and the ability to break through enemy air defense. The X-101 has no restrictions on its shape and was able to give it a shape with less radar signature. And a more advanced navigation system allows the X-101 to fly lower than the Caliber (30 meters and 50 meters, respectively). It also has a unit for shooting IR traps to deceive enemy anti-aircraft missiles. And all this makes this missile much more successful in breaking through enemy air defense.\n\nThis is what they have been demonstrating lately.\n\nThat is, the X-101 has more potential for modernization, as proved today. Moreover, even with a warhead of 800 kg, the X-101 flies much further, hits much harder and is much better able to break through enemy air defense.\n\nAnd hence what we see. \u201cCalibers\u201d are almost never used in attacks on Ukraine, and the entire burden of attacks on enemy rear lines (in this segment) was shouldered by the now modernized X-101..."}, {"event": "Protest Against President Maia Sandu", "description": "President Maia Sandu of Moldova attended the opening ceremony of a power line in Gagauzia, but was met with protests from local residents.", "location": "Gagauzia, Moldova", "id": "40f2a05a-ba61-5e11-8f79-7d2213221294", "time": "2024-03-29 09:45:39", "original": "President of Moldova Maia Sandu arrived in Gagauzia for the opening ceremony of the power line, local residents greeted her with protests.
