If on Monday the ice slides, swings, carousels and tents for celebrations were just being erected, then on Tuesday the youth were already making full use of them for games and friendly competitions.\n\nFrom the very morning, boys and girls went sledding down the hills. It was believed that the more fun this fun was, the more happiness the youth would expect in the future. Anyone who was sad during \u201cZigrysh\u201d, according to legend, risked spending the entire next year in melancholy.\n\nAnother traditional entertainment on this day was horse-drawn cart riding. The boys demonstrated their dexterity and courage in relay races and competitions: tug-of-war, conquering a pole smeared with grease, riding a pair of swings and other activities. During the day, boys and girls built snow forts and played snowballs, and in the evening they gathered together to communicate, sing songs and treat themselves to hot pancakes with hearty fillings.\n\nAll this was started in order to give young people the opportunity to take a closer look at each other and meet their soulmate. Hence another meaning of the word \u201cflirting\u201d - the time when guys and girls flirt with each other, choosing potential brides and grooms. It was believed that the sympathy that arose on this day could result in a strong union.\n\nIn addition, the couple had enough time to make a final decision about marriage, because after Maslenitsa Lent began, during which it was forbidden to get married. Wedding festivities resumed only on Krasnaya Gorka, the first Sunday after Easter. Marriage on this day, according to legend, promised the young people a long and happy family life.\n\nOn the second day of Maslenitsa week they also began to invite people over for pancakes. Relatives, friends, neighbors and mummers were invited to the festive table, and they went from house to house with congratulations. People believed that the more guests and the more plentiful the food, the more successful the year would be for the hosts. It was also an excellent opportunity to meet the parents of a potential bride or groom.\n\nAccording to folk traditions, on the second day of Maslenitsa week you should not be sad, lie, envy or quarrel with loved ones, as this can lead to protracted conflicts and misfortunes. In the old days, during Zaigrysh people tried not to be alone and not spend the whole day at home, so as not to miss out on their happiness. Also on this day they put off all serious financial matters and did not talk about their dreams. People believed that voiced nightmares would quickly come true, but good dreams, on the contrary, would never come true.\n\nPancakes are a traditional Maslenitsa treat, without which it is impossible to imagine this holiday. In Rus', a circle of hot, ruddy dough symbolized the sun and the imminent arrival of spring.\n\nYou can bake pancakes from the first day of Maslenitsa until the end of the holiday. At the same time, according to legend, the first batch should be given to the poor or treated to neighbors in order to remember the ancestors. However, in the modern world it is not necessary to follow old traditions. The main thing is to enjoy the holiday atmosphere and get a charge of positive emotions."}, {"event": "S-400 and Pantsir-S1 Air Defense Systems Engage Ukrainian GMLRS Missiles", "description": "Footage from Z-publics shows the S-400 air defense system and the Pantsir-S1 air defense missile system in action against incoming Ukrainian GMLRS missiles.
