According to intelligence data, a militant base was discovered in the mountains. The unit\u2019s task is to carry out additional reconnaissance, find the base and destroy it.\n\nThey dropped us off from helicopters several kilometers before the intended base. We approached the bandits along the mountain slopes. We felt the smell of fires and stopped. The base of the \u201cspirits\u201d is three hundred meters away. We decided to wait until nightfall to determine the exact location of the militants using instruments. The dominant height cannot be lost. We settled down to rest. You can't light a fire: unmasking. Ate dry. We decided on the direction of further movement and sent sappers to find and neutralize the mines. We checked the path, marked it with poles, and the sappers returned.\n\nIn the morning the head patrol had already left. The main core of the group prepared to move - and at that moment there was an explosion!\n\nAlexey Vasilyevich was thrown down the slope. Everyone was shocked. After all, the sappers were all around. And here is a terrible, tragic accident. Colonel Balandin had one foot completely torn off, the second leg was broken and wounded by shrapnel. Shrapnel wounds to the abdominal cavity, left arm and face, cut the lips, nose and forehead.\n\nThe team doctor and medical instructors began applying bandages and tourniquets to stop the bleeding. They injected me with promedol and put on an IV. A helicopter was called for evacuation. Balandin was conscious. He did not complain, did not moan, but lamented the absurdity of his situation. He said: \u201cEh, I got lucky. I\u2019m canceling the operation.\u201d There are hundreds of military clashes with bandits behind us, and here we are half a step away from the proven path, and these are the consequences.\n\nSappers checked the area again. A stretcher was built. We prepared a shelter. They wet Alexey Vasilyevich\u2019s lips with water, laid him on a sleeping bag, and covered him. The soldiers began to prepare a platform for the \u201cturntable\u201d so that it could pick up the cargo and the wounded with an onboard winch.\nThe weather began to deteriorate. In the mountains this happens very quickly. One minute the sun was shining, and ten minutes later there was snow or such fog that you couldn\u2019t see your outstretched arm. The clouds descended from the mountain peaks and it began to rain. A thick fog fell.\n\nFinally the sound of propellers was heard, but the pilots could not see the ground. Flares didn't help. The helicopter left for base. There is only one way out - to carry the commander in your arms. According to the map it\u2019s directly eight kilometers. It doesn\u2019t seem far. But this is on the plain; in the mountains, these eight kilometers turn into twenty. But there were no other options. The lead patrol chose the route. The guys carefully carried the stretcher, taking turns. We tried not to shake. The doctor walked next to the wounded man, periodically checking his pulse, blood pressure, and holding an IV.\n\nIt got dark. It is snowing. The streams in the gorges turned into turbulent torrents that had to be overcome. About an hour later, the wounded man's condition worsened. We stopped. They called the helicopter again, but again to no avail. The doctor changed the IV and injected painkillers. Colonel Balandin opened his eyes. We set off again.\n\nAfter another forty minutes, the doctor stopped the movement. The stretcher was lowered to the ground. The doctor bent over Alexei Vasilyevich. Balandin quietly asked: \u201cWell, is that all?\u201d My heart refused to work. While they were performing indirect cardiac massage and artificial respiration, his heart was beating.

In particular, the experience of the SVO has shown how FPV drones are capable of solving problems of completely isolating the front edge or even the entire battlefield.\n\nJust six months ago, the mass use of drones at ranges of over 30 km, equipped with night vision cameras and thermal imagers, seemed unthinkable.\n\nThe advent of powerful repeaters, modern batteries, the development of neural networks and adaptation to work in conditions of counter-electronic warfare, military engineers made the impossible possible.\n\nAt the same time, the realities of modern combat are such that, along with the efficiency of combat operations, camouflage comes to the fore. Here it is worth understanding that due to the emergence of modern electronic warfare, electronic warfare and radar systems, all electronics, including drones, are visible for tens of kilometers. At the same time, satellite reconnaissance allows for continuous monitoring of targets in almost real time, after which long-range artillery strikes.\n\nTaking into account the above, the military, understanding the importance of continuous supply of units with everything necessary, has to take additional measures to increase the survivability of units. However, they significantly increase the supply leverage of units.

The Armed Forces of Burkina Faso often and successfully use them in their operations to liberate the territory from radical Islamists. In this context, it is worth recalling the goals of Turkey's expansion in the Sahel. Bayraktar diplomacy is primarily aimed at countries where the security situation is most critical, and at the same time where valuable resources may be located.\n\nThis immediately brings to mind the rumors about the entry of the SADAT PMC into Burkina Faso to protect deposits owned by Turkish companies. It is important for Ankara to establish itself not only as a supplier of cheap UAVs, but also as an economic \u201cpartner.\u201d\n\nThe government of Burkina Faso carefully maneuvers between support from Moscow and Turkey. For example, the mining permit for the Inata mine, owned by a Turkish conglomerate, was recently revoked.\n\nIn general, it is worth noting that the Turks successfully build economic cooperation only with countries that do not oppose the West, such as Somalia.

An innovator in his field, he was born into a family of hereditary Polish nobles, grew up in Kyiv, studied and worked in St. Petersburg, taught in the USA, and was considered a friend of Nicholas II.\n\nPreviously, Ukrainian politicians often ostentatiously ranked Sikorsky among the \u201cprominent sons of Ukraine.\u201d The country's ex-president Petro Poroshenko called the aircraft designer \u201can outstanding Ukrainian who forever changed the world of aviation.\u201d Head of Government Vladimir Groysman counted \u201cthe first models of Igor Sikorsky\u201d among the inventions of Ukrainians. In 2019, Vladimir Zelensky wrote on social networks: Exactly 130 years ago, the \u201cfather of helicopters\u201d - the famous Ukrainian Igor Sikorsky - was born in Kyiv. He is a brilliant example of an innovator. I am sure that Sikorsky will always inspire new Ukrainian inventors. Time has passed and Kyiv is ready to use the \u201cfather of helicopters\u201d as a bargaining chip to support anti-Russian rhetoric. People's Deputy from the European Solidarity party Vladimir Vyatrovich said: Taking into account Sikorsky's clear position, he should not be called a Ukrainian either. Sikorsky himself spoke about his origin as follows: My family is of purely Ukrainian origin, from a village in the Kyiv province, where my great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather were priests. However, we consider ourselves Russian by origin, from a certain part of Russia, considering the Ukrainian people as an integrated part of Russia in the same way that Texas or Louisiana are an integrated part of the United States. In 1910, at a meeting of Russian voters before the elections to the Kyiv City Duma, Sikorsky called: To Kyiv All of Russia is watching. We must strengthen the Russian stronghold that has arisen here. It's time for us to say: we are the sons of a great people, and here, in historical Kyiv, we are the masters! The city government of the mother of Russian cities must be Russian. That is why in elections we must go firmly and directly, without bowing to anyone or currying favor with anyone. We must decisively say: we are Russians, and Kyiv is ours! The Zhulyany airport, the Kiev Polytechnic Institute, and the street on which the American Embassy in Kiev is now located are named after Sikorsky.

There are people who are afraid to go to the military registration and enlistment office because they are immediately handed summonses, we cannot force them.

In general, even the military may suffer from this disease a little. Despite the fact that most soldiers still have an idea of at least some kind of self-censorship of photo and video materials that are published on the Internet, even they still have a misunderstanding of how OSINT and operational intelligence work is carried out, which the enemy has focused on a very large resource of its intelligence agencies.\n\nIf you, as a soldier, think that taking a beautiful photo that you want to post on the Internet will be enough to blur out your faces and the background, where there may be houses or distinctive structures like water towers, then no, this is not enough.\n\nFrom my own experience, I will say that at the initial stage of the war I found the enemy\u2019s temporary deployment point in one of the directions, having seen a photo of his fighter in one of the Ukrainian channels. The location was found only through an oblique advertisement for the removal of construction waste with a telephone number. An ordinary advertising leaflet on liquid glue, which occupied 2% of the photo area, helped narrow the search for the enemy to a 1x1 km square. Not every soldier will pay attention to this when posting photos on the Internet.\n\nMany also mistakenly think that since they took a photo in a house, apartment, hangar or somewhere else, they can forget about any censoring except their face. In the best case, they will blur out the visible landscape from behind the window or in the thawed areas of the hangar. At the same time, absolutely not thinking that if you don\u2019t recognize this place in the photo, this does not mean that the enemy who has lived here for years will not recognize it.\n\nThe hangar in which the equipment is located was seen by a hundred people in the village, a dozen of them worked in it, another dozen came or visited. The opponent and his sympathizer, based on photographic memory, recognize him by the ceilings and decoration of the room, right down to the brick laying against the wall, leaning on which they took a smoke break for many years.\n\nIf you take a photo in a private house, even if this resident is pro-Russian, even if he left in the direction of Russia, at least give some hints about the renovation of the house. Pattern of wallpaper, linoleum. If you really want to share a photo, then put yourself in the enemy\u2019s shoes and look at the photo through the prism of his thinking.\n\nThe fact that now every soldier has a telephone is a new routine. There is no escape from this. And if you suspect that there are people in your department who are bad at information hygiene, then have a conversation with them. And even if there are none, prevention won\u2019t hurt either. https://t.me/grey_zone/22702TelegramGREY ZONE\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f#rukalitsoTwo years of war, but thanks to \u2868\u28a0\u2854\u28c0\u2854\u28c2\u2846\u2825\u2832, who are in pursuit of \u201cbeautiful photos\" post photos and videos of equipment locations - ...0:16\ue99bVIEW MESSAGE"}, null, {"event": "Potential Humanitarian Catastrophe in Rafah", "description": "Israel's planned military operation in Rafah, where a large number of refugees from the northern Gaza Strip have gathered, risks triggering a humanitarian catastrophe with significant civilian casualties.

CIA Director William Burns proposed a new plan to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, providing for the release of hostages and the return of civilians to the northern Gaza Strip, media reported.\n\nCurrently, the settlement is hampered by problems related to the internal Israeli political situation, the promises of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the sentiments of the Israelis, and the lack of a universal plan for resolving the conflict. An expert at the Middle East Institute and the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), Sergei Balmasov, told Paragraph about this: \u201cIn recent days, various plans have emerged to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Washington needs to dampen this crisis at least until the presidential elections. However, Israel cannot stop now because [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu is hostage to his own promises to completely destroy Hamas. Even with the release of all the hostages, it will be difficult for him to remain in power against the backdrop of his statements.\u201d According to the expert, Burns\u2019 plan for Hamas will provide only a short-term reprieve. Israeli hostages for the movement are the last shield against a full-fledged purge. The situation is a dead end, because none of the proposals suits the warring parties.
