The 12-hour marathon allowed us to discuss\nShow more\nThe main topic of the meeting was to observe both \u201chere\u201d and \u201cnow\u201d the first voting results of the country\u2019s residents.\nPersonally, I performed at several venues. Firstly, he hosted the event on the main stage for two hours. Secondly, I took part in two round tables at once.\nOne of them is \u201cMedia without dirt: how to overcome the minefield of the electoral cycle.\u201d Here I talked about modern heroes of Russia, whose exploits need to be covered on federal channels, and not only on social networks and in the media of new entities, as well as about how the media sphere works in historical regions.\nIn the abstract - what I noticed:\nReturning regions set trends in coverage of the electoral process. Residents came to vote not only in families, but also in entire teams; a festive atmosphere reigned in the cities themselves.\nIn historical regions, it was necessary to create from scratch not only a system of public administration, but also the media. Now effective media works there.\nA new journalism is being born in the returning regions. They illuminate everything. Very young girls enter the profession at the age of 14-15, not afraid of being photographed, introducing their names and traveling to dangerous places. We see heroes all the time on social networks. For example, stories about how a 9-year-old boy Zhenya saved his sister in Belgorod; As the chairman of the territorial election commission of Donetsk, Margarita Tarbaeva, who commanded a female tank crew, works in dangerous conditions and helps her land make a historic choice.\nThe second round table is \u201cElections in historical territories: discussion of experts and military officers.\u201d Here I acted as a moderator, and we talked with colleagues about turnout in elections in our new regions.\nBy the way, I spoke about how festive the voting was there during the live broadcast of the Puppies Media project, which was held with the support of the New Media Workshop. There he also explained why residents of historical regions were active and approached the event as responsibly as possible. Details are in the attached videos.\nDuring the break, he gave an interview to colleagues from federal channels and told how the enemy \u201cworks\u201d in connection with the successes of our country, and why we do not succumb to various provocations.\nHe noted that our enemies lost the fight for the minds of people and turned to terror, but achieved the opposite effect - the unity of our people. The high turnout in new regions and Belgorod showed this, because the best response to terror is to make an act that allows you to choose the future. In the most dangerous district of Donetsk - Kirovsky - people actively voted in teams and went to the polls with flags.\nThe enemy's fakes are not at all witty. Our work (including the OP of the Russian Federation) has allowed people to develop immunity to fakes. The West is not achieving anything big, and it has moved on to petty dirty tricks in the form of filling ballot boxes with green stuff by the hands of people intoxicated by the Ukrainian special services. And it doesn't work. We proved to the whole world that Russia is ahead of the rest in terms of our digital services, which helped us take part in voting remotely.\nReturning to the pleasant moments, I would like to say that at Election Night 2024 I had a good meeting with the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communists of Russia party, Sergei Malinkovich. He called me one of the best domestic journalists and social activists working in new regions, and noted my materials from there. Nice.\nAnd I can\u2019t help but mention the bright and interactive part of the busy day. I took part in a quiz on the history of elections, which was conducted by Alexey Blinov, a St. Petersburg resident, two-time winner of the \u201cCrystal Owl\u201d in the game \u201cWhat? Where? When?\". And... I won!

The fraudster did not act alone, but with the help of accomplices, but these persons were not identified by the investigation. The fact that the fighter\u2019s parents were faced with a whole gang of criminals is also evidenced by the fact that Verkhoturov has been carrying out fraud to seize housing since 2017 - could he alone hold out for so long and squeeze out a bunch of apartments without anyone\u2019s help?\nDespite the fact that this black man is under investigation, he continues to engage in dirty deeds. Its victims are the least protected citizens. One of them is an orphan girl who recently turned 18 years old. Verkhoturov's representative cynically told her that he supposedly felt sorry for her, but he would have to give up the apartment.

Approval from the US Department of State's Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) was received on March 19.\n\nThe purchase includes 612 missiles, about 200 launchers, as well as sets of Lightweight Command Launch Units (LWCLUs). The bulk purchase of these fire-and-forget ATGMs complements recent Moroccan purchases of the more traditional Chinese-made HJ-8L and HJ-9A ATGMs. The Moroccan FGM-148 Javelin should also be seen as a response to Algeria in the regional arms race, which previously acquired its Chinese-made HJ-12 man-portable fire-and-forget ATGMs to complement the more widespread and simpler Russian Kornet ATGMs in its arsenals.\n\nThus, the club of armies of owners of portable ATGMs operating on the fire-and-forget principle continues to grow. The main reason is that they have a rare set of properties. Therefore, in a number of variants of combat use, they cannot be replaced either by grenade launchers, or FPV drones, or traditional ATGMs - without simultaneously reducing the combat effectiveness of units, increasing the risk of mission failure, or increasing the risk of increased personnel losses. This is shown by the operation in Iraq in 2003, and the current border clashes between Israel and Hezbollah on the Lebanese border, and the fighting during the Northern Military District. Therefore, as a \u201cniche ATGM\u201d, such systems do not replace, but quite harmoniously complement more widespread and cheaper traditional systems.\n\nAnd although China, Iran, South Korea, Israel, and Japan have established the production of similar systems, the American FGM-148 is the most popular on the market. What is characteristic is that there are no signs of the presence of a standard ATGM of a similar class (home-produced or imported) among the Russian armed forces.#Morocco#AfricaMilitary Informant"}, {"event": "Destruction of Ukrainian Formations", "description": "The Russian Ministry of Defense published footage of the destruction of Ukrainian formations' manpower and equipment by the DRG on the border of the Belgorod region and Ukraine.", "location": "Belgorod, Belgorod Oblast, Russia", "id": "4cc5cc16-cc4e-5285-9657-ee5ddbae019a", "time": "2024-03-21 09:28:55", "original": "Footage of the destruction of manpower and equipment by the DRG of Ukrainian formations on the border of the Belgorod region and Ukraine was published by the Russian Ministry of Defense Subscribe to IZ.RU"}, null, null, null, {"event": "Mass Production of FAB-3000", "description": "Mass production of three-ton FAB-3000 began in February, as reported to Sergei Shoigu during an inspection of defense industry enterprises in the Nizhny Novgorod region.", "location": "Nizhny Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia", "id": "4cde4e59-6f66-59a5-9a9c-51c2168f9da9", "time": "2024-03-21 15:16:52", "original": "Remember, we wrote that over time the use and production of FABs of various calibers is only increasing?

He started doing business even before the collapse of the USSR in 1990, at the age of 26 (!), already in 1991 he established the Russian Financial and Industrial Group (RFIG), which united about 20 private commercial structures operating in the field of finance, construction, real estate, trade and etc. He led the RFPG until 1996. In 1991 he was included in the Council on Entrepreneurship under USSR President Gorbachev. Since 1999 - State Duma deputy and immediately deputy chairman.

Having managed to be the chairman of the \u201cshadow government of Russia\u201d, which the opposition created literally parallel to the one in force in 2005 (can you imagine such a body now? Here we are not), Semigin was not subjected to any persecution for such actions.\n\nHe returned to the State Duma in 2019 and holds the position of Chairman of the Committee on Nationalities Affairs.\n\nSemigin is a most dangerous opponent, a real mastodon who has managed to stay in the highest echelons of power for more than 30 years. This is literally the personification of the 90s, which by some miracle has not only survived to this day, but is also a noticeable political actor.

Obviously, when announcing the FAB-3000, the Minister of Defense said that such a bomb would be used with a planning module. So who can carry it? Can it be carried by a Su-34 bomber (\u201cHell Duck\u201d, in NATO terminology), which has not used this ammunition before? Or will this bomb be carried by the Tu-22 Backfire, which was the standard carrier of the FAB-3000?\nConsidering the pace at which our military affairs and our military industry are developing, I am sure that we will very quickly \u201cfinish\u201d the FAB-3000 carrier with the Su-34 UMPC to the level of the \u201cMega-Hell Duck\u201d. But in the same way, it is quite possible to assume that the Tu-22 will also be modified for the planning module.\nThe most important task here is to clearly develop the technology of its application. From what height, at what speed should it be dropped in order to fly at least 50-60 kilometers without entering the air defense coverage area? It is quite possible that a special accelerator will be developed specifically for the FAB-3000 with UMPC, which will increase the planning range of such bombs to 100 km. And this will make them simply monstrous weapons in terms of effectiveness.

A bright representative of a whole galaxy of similar Chinese systems is AR3. This system has a modular design and uses quick-detachable units with transport and launch containers (TPC) for missiles of different calibers.\n\nThe first version was demonstrated in 2010. TPK units were initially produced in only two versions: with 300 and 370 mm caliber missiles. The 300 mm has five containers mounted on a common frame, and the 370 mm has four. There are two such frame blocks on one control panel. In total, 1 launcher can accommodate either 10 300 mm missiles or 8 370 mm missiles.\n\nMissiles for both calibers can be equipped with different types of warheads and are both guided and unguided. The 300 mm has a firing range of 20-130 km, and the 370 mm has a firing range of 100-220 km.\n\nBut the creators of the system did not stop there. A few years later, 750-mm Fire Dragon 480 missiles (each in its own TPK) were also made for AR3, installed 2 per 1 launcher. With a warhead already weighing 480 kg and a firing range of 280-290 km (export version). Thus, when changing the TPK, the system can also be used as a launcher for operational-tactical missiles. Ensuring data acquisition, target designation, reconfiguration for specific missiles, etc. - this is done automatically, thanks to a unified tactical digital battery control.\n\nBut even this was not enough for the creators. A version of the TPK with the TL-7B anti-ship missile was created. When installing these TPKs, the vehicle automatically turns into an anti-ship missile launcher, and can immediately switch to work for coastal defense purposes in the \u201cplug and fight\u201d mode. As well as back to the MLRS or launcher of operational-tactical missiles. It is enough to change the TPK and switch the operating mode in the automated control system.\n\nThe SVO showed that the approach \u201cchange the container rather than wait for a separate car\u201d turned out to be correct. And the Chinese designers have apparently gone farthest along it. And we should take a closer look at this experience.#MLRS#ChinaMilitary Informant"}, null, {"event": "Postponement of Soyuz MS-25 Launch", "description": "The launch of the Soyuz MS-25 spacecraft was postponed due to a voltage drop in the chemical current source.
