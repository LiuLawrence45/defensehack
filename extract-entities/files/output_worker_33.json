There were also voices from France calling for stricter customs regulations.\n\nFor now, the restrictions do not apply to wheat, but the European Commission is likely to take action if, for example, wheat prices in the EU fall sharply due to Ukrainian imports. The extent of the latter's influence on the EU market is now the subject of heated debate.\n\nAfter approval by the European Parliament and EU countries, the new rules will come into force on June 6 and will be valid for one year.

Some landed at one end of the Belgorod region, others filmed TikTok on their border. There is one interesting detail: American and other foreign mercenaries took part in all these provocations.

We all remember the footage, very similar tactics of the enemy on the Kherson front. GOAL: Breaking through the state border, occupying border settlements, the capture of which could be presented as the inability of the state to protect its citizens. What entails undermining the authority of the President of Russia through attempts to disrupt the elections taking place at that moment. RESULT: The landing of two landing groups using UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters initially provided the enemy with a beautiful picture for TikTok, but all further plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were doomed to failure .\n\nHaving landed 4 km from the point, the RDK* militants got lost, and then began to rush.

And all this in interaction with the personal characteristics of a person. \u201cIn advanced medical groups, patients are often admitted immediately \u201cfrom the front\u201d and rarely stay longer than a few hours,\u201d writes Kuchits. \u201cBut, nevertheless, we try to apply the basic principles of early psychocorrection in working with the wounded Organization of safe and basic comfort for rest and hygiene of the wounded, pain relief and treatment, provision of food and drink, clean clothing, attention of personnel - already allow us to significantly reduce the impact of combat stressors.\n\nFriendly communication and discussion with the wounded about the traumas they have suffered, based on logical argumentation and accessible explanation - in most cases, allows us to restore the mental balance of patients.\n\nWe are not psychologists, but we hope that our work increases the effectiveness of further medical and socio-psychological rehabilitation of combatants.\" And if you knew how difficult this post-war rehabilitation of front-line soldiers is!!...
