Depending on their role and degree of participation, they are found guilty under paragraphs. \u201ca\u201d, \u201cg\u201d, \u201ck\u201d part 2 art. 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (murder) part 2 of Art. 316 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (not previously promised concealment of a particularly serious crime).\n\nThe crime was investigated by an investigator from the Investigative Committee.\n\nThe court found that at the end of February 2023, on different days, the accused, while in the premises of a non-working kindergarten located in the city of Novaya Kakhovka, drank alcoholic beverages with a woman and a man unfamiliar to them. While drinking alcohol, verbal altercations occurred between the individuals involved.\n\nDuring the conflict in the first case, one of the men struck the victim\u2019s head multiple times with a hammer, from which the latter died on the spot. The second man saw what happened, but did not report it to law enforcement agencies, and subsequently helped cover up the traces of the crime.\n\nIn the second case, one of the accused began to beat the man, but the latter managed to break free and hide from the attacker. Subsequently, the two accomplices found the victim in another room of the kindergarten and began to strike him multiple times on the legs and head with a hammer and hands until he stopped showing signs of life. The bodies of the dead were hidden in the kindergarten premises, thrown into a hole in the floor and covered with household garbage.\n\nIn March 2023, the defendants, while in an abandoned apartment in the city of Novaya Kakhovka, drank alcohol with two other men who also had no fixed place of residence. While drinking alcohol, a verbal quarrel occurred between them with one of the men, which did not end in anything, since the two victims fell asleep. Subsequently, making sure that the men were sleeping, the accused, using an awl and a knife, killed their offender.\n\nThe murder of the second man was committed in order to cover up the crime, initially by beating him and then finishing him off with a hammer on the head. Both victims remained in the apartment until they were discovered. The court, taking into account the opinion of the state prosecutor, found the defendants guilty and sentenced them to imprisonment for a term of 16 to 19 years, to be served in a high-security penal colony.

Synopsis: The circle of communication and connections that we form with people are certainly important and have an influence on us that is difficult to underestimate . Over the course of our lives, we gain and sometimes lose those who were our friends. Resonant events with which our time is rich also leave an imprint on relationships - both between people and entire nations.\n\nThe hero of our comic is Ernesto, a Cuban who voluntarily came to help the country where he studied and lived. Already during combat coordination, he sees how many different people there are among the Russian volunteers. And everyone is ready to fight side by side, help and cover each other.\n\nAt the front, friendship is more than friendship, it becomes a real military brotherhood. Courage, trust in each other and mutual assistance are often the key to victory here. And every day, fate prepares fighters to test their best human qualities in difficult field conditions.\ud83d\udcccYou can download the comic using the links: RU|EN#Bakhmut#Russia#Ukraine@rybar We hope you liked the comic from our artists.

According to Navalny himself, he was always taken out for a walk in Kharp at 6.30 in the morning. Were the walks on that day rescheduled? If not, what do the words \u201cafter a walk\u201d mean in the understanding of the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service?2. If, as the management of the hospital in the city of Labytnangi reports, the ambulance team reached the colony in 7 minutes, why were further resuscitation measures carried out in the unsuitable conditions of the colony, and not in a specialized intensive care unit? It is located just 1 km from the zone - in a branch of the hospital in the village of Kharp, as indicated on its website.\n\n3. Why did state propaganda immediately announce a \u201cbroken blood clot\u201d if, in the opinion of qualified pathologists, this could only be established by an autopsy? What did the propagandists rely on and who made this diagnosis?4. Navalny spent 295 days in a punishment cell. Does this mean that, in accordance with the Criminal Executive Code, there are 27 - according to the number of placements of a politician in an isolation ward - medical reports on the possibility of being in a punishment cell for health reasons? Who signed them? 5. According to the law \u201cOn Burial\u201d, the release of the body to relatives after an autopsy cannot be delayed longer than two days from the moment the cause of death is established. The Investigative Committee claims that due to its failure to identify it, a histological examination has been ordered (let us explain: histology is capable of, among other things, identifying traces of chemical exposure).

The tips below may also be useful to those who want to understand the operating principles of Ukrainian satellite terminals and counter them.\ud83d\udd39Follow the instructions of the person who sold (supplied) it to you and do not turn off your head. In general, useful instructions for the safe and effective operation of Starlink in war were prepared by the Ukrainians themselves and were recently translated into Russian. Don't neglect other people's experiences. And, of course, remember that Starlink, for obvious reasons, \u201chas not passed state tests\u201d and is not officially authorized for use by anyone.\ud83d\udd39Use camouflage and shielding. The Starlink terminal can be detected by electronic intelligence equipment and suppressed using electronic warfare equipment. Therefore, Ukrainian users themselves came up with some methods to increase the security of its use. The main thing is to place the terminal below ground level. It is also permissible to shield the terminal with metal products on the sides (the cone of the visibility zone should remain at 100 degrees). Study electronic radio and electronic warfare. Do not place it near important objects. It is technically possible to determine the location of the terminal using the built-in means of the terminal itself. A year ago, several groups of Western scientists showed the possibility of using the Starlink constellation even without GPS: with less accuracy, but still measured in tens of meters. Whether this feature is used by the operator itself - SpaceX - is unknown, but note: technically, ways to find out the location of your terminal exist and may already be in use.\ud83d\udd39Do not send sensitive data. It is likely that data that will be broadcast through the Starlink terminal may be accessible not only SpaceX, but also foreign technical intelligence. Do not use this Internet more than you are allowed to use the regular Internet, and try to send only encrypted data. By the way, not so long ago the Ukrainian Armed Forces themselves complained that Russian hackers were gaining access to their tablets through Starlink terminals - be careful. Don\u2019t forget that satellite terminals can be turned off at any time. You can remember the famous scandal that happened in Ukraine in 2022, when an attack The Armed Forces of Ukraine for the Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean Satellite Internet suddenly stopped functioning. Elon Musk then said that Starlink rules prohibited the use of their equipment for \u201coffensive military operations.\u201d If you use Starlink, have it as a backup link. Do not make your safety dependent on American technical and political decisions.\n\nUse wisely.@rogozin_alexeyTelegramSVO Institute / People's translationSatellite Internet Starlink\nMilitary Use Course\n\nUnofficially translated from Ukrainian in 2024#folk translationStepanets_Naron\u2026ranslation.pdf9.8 MB\u00b7/9.8 MBVIEW MESSAGE"}, null, {"event": "Murder of Maxim Kuzminov", "description": "Spanish news agency EFE confirmed the murder of Maxim Kuzminov in the province of Alicante.
