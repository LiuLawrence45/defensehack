Apparently, they were left as a barrier in front of the Russian troops so that the \u201ccadroviki\u201d would have the opportunity to dig in along the Seversky Donets Canal.\n\nThis has already happened in Artyomovsk, Soledar, Avdeevka and many other places and every time it led to the collapse of the front. #BattlesDenazification\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u23cf\ufe0f*\ufe0f\u20e3\u2796TelegramDenazificationChasov Yar.

Curva-beaver, yeah.\n\nThere would be no dignity in admitting guilt...Anatoly Nesmiyan Regarding the long-suffering dam in Orsk (as well as other structures that are cracking today in different regions of the country). Yes, of course, the initial cause of the flood in the Orenburg region was the release of water from a reservoir located upstream. It\u2019s even strange that they talk about it extremely sparingly, since it seems that the spillway was organized late, which was the reason for very large volumes of water in a short period of time.\n\nBut we're talking about the dam. Any hydraulic (as well as other) structure must be built taking into account calculations that include a margin of its strength. This reserve is also taken not out of thin air, but from standards and empirical observations of the history of water rises. Therefore, in theory, the dam had to be designed for sufficiently high water levels, flow speed, pressure and a host of other parameters.\n\nThe second point is the operation of the structure. If it is stated that beavers gnawed a hole in the dam (oh, those famous \u201cbeavers\u201d), then the question is not for the beavers, but for those who are obliged to control the structure and at least its integrity.\n\nThe Ural, by the way, is a serious river. Not just any river Vonyuchka, but quite a large and complex one. The third longest in Europe, by the way. As you know, the epic hero Vasily Ivanovich drowned in it and did not swim. For this reason alone, hydraulic structures on such a river must also be considered seriously and without foolishness, taking into account the most varied and most extreme conditions. Therefore, the reference to the fact that the current situation is unique is untenable.\n\nMost likely, we are faced with a typical modern Russian approach of banal theft of everything. From a project where they stole what they could and let a laboratory assistant count it for a hundred rubles, to a construction project where they stole everything. Adjustment for theft is an eternal Russian problem (\u201cIf I fall asleep and wake up in a hundred years and they ask me what is happening in Russia now, I will answer: they drink and steal\u201d). The current time is not an exception, but rather a double or triple confirmation of what Saltykov-Shchedrin said.\n\nTherefore, the culprits, of course, will be found and punished, but the original problem will remain intact. And that means next year the breakthrough will happen somewhere else. And it\u2019s good, if only in a dam."}, null, null, null, null, {"event": "Rehabilitation of Blind Ukrainian Soldiers", "description": "In Lviv Oblast, Ukrainian soldiers who lost their sight due to injuries are undergoing rehabilitation.

What will this change? The development of such ammunition in many countries of the world is a priority in the development of military equipment of the ground forces. What are the features of the technology? The essence of such ammunition is the remotely controlled activation of fuses immediately at the moment of their approach to air or ground targets at a distance of 10-20 m.\n\nThe range to targets can be measured both by laser rangefinders (in the case of using 2A42 cannons mounted on BMPTs, or from 2A72 BMP-3M cannons), and using guidance radars when using such projectiles in the Pantsir-S1 ammunition load.\n\nThe final detonation command will be issued to laser photodetectors located in the tail sections of the projectiles, after which the ammunition will be detonated and the target will be hit. Projectiles of this type are highly effective in intercepting a large number of targets: from maneuvering kamikaze UAVs to stealth tactical and cruise missiles. What are the differences between the Western concept of programmable detonation and the Russian one? In German 35-mm fuses of the AHEAD type (also known as ABM/KETF) programming of the fuse is carried out not on the trajectory, but at the moment of exit from the barrel. The detonation time of each projectile is set after comparing data on its initial speed and braking speed with data on the distance to the target at the time of the shot. A similar system is relevant for German Puma infantry fighting vehicles. What are the disadvantages of the AHEAD system? The Western concept of using such ammunition is based on the fact that the projectiles are programmed in advance. It is impossible to make changes to the flight program due to changing shooting conditions. The moment of detonation of Russian shells can be adjusted along the trajectory depending on the behavior of the target. This allows you to make shooting more flexible and optimize ammunition consumption. @MChroniclesBot\u2014send your photos and videos from the front.

The Bison burned quickly and brightly, leaving behind only a corroded iron box on the Ukrainian steppes. Or, as the steppes are called in North America, prairies.\nSuper Bison is formidable but heavy\nThe Canadian armored personnel carrier is the most modern armored vehicle in the national army. It entered service only two years ago. Even at the design stage, the Canadian military wanted to get a universal, durable and reliable vehicle with powerful armor and good weapons. In general, the engineers and designers managed to bring the idea to life: during testing, the armored car showed good results. The 8x8 chassis gave excellent off-road performance, the powerful armor provided a high level of crew protection, and the armament, including an automatic cannon, machine gun, grenade launchers and anti-tank missiles, made it a formidable force on the battlefield. The only \u201cbut\u201d turned all the pros into a big minus: the car turned out to be too heavy, and the high silhouette made it an excellent target for anti-tank weapons.\nThere are no statistics on the losses of such vehicles in the Northern Military District zone. But the fact that they are burning can be seen from photographic material posted on the Internet.\nThe Bisons have no business running around the Donbass prairies.\n___\nPerformance characteristics of the Super Bison armored personnel carrier (Canada)\nCountry of origin: Canada\nCombat weight - 28 500 kg\nMachine length - 7.62 meters\nWidth - 2.78 meters\nHeight - 3.16 meters\nEngine power - 450 hp.

The technology enables flexible shooting and optimized ammunition consumption.", "location": "Russia", "id": "c2e3dfc9-0806-5eed-a7b0-cc9b2d73b8c8", "time": "2024-04-09 21:16:59", "original": "Military chronicle: BMPT \"Terminator\" and BMP-3 will receive projectiles with programmable detonation. What will this change? The development of such ammunition in many countries of the world is a priority in the development of military equipment of the ground forces. What are the features of the technology? The essence of such ammunition is the remotely controlled activation of fuses immediately at the moment of their approach to air or ground targets at a distance of 10-20 m.\n\nThe range to targets can be measured both by laser rangefinders (in the case of using 2A42 cannons mounted on BMPTs, or from 2A72 BMP-3M cannons), and using guidance radars when using such projectiles in the Pantsir-S1 ammunition load.\n\nThe final detonation command will be issued to laser photodetectors located in the tail sections of the projectiles, after which the ammunition will be detonated and the target will be hit. Projectiles of this type are highly effective in intercepting a large number of targets: from maneuvering kamikaze UAVs to stealth tactical and cruise missiles. What are the differences between the Western concept of programmable detonation and the Russian one? In German 35-mm fuses of the AHEAD type (also known as ABM/KETF) programming of the fuse is carried out not on the trajectory, but at the moment of exit from the barrel. The detonation time of each projectile is set after comparing data on its initial speed and braking speed with data on the distance to the target at the time of the shot. A similar system is relevant for the German Puma infantry fighting vehicles. What are the disadvantages of the AHEAD system? The Western concept of using such ammunition is based on the fact that the projectiles are programmed in advance. It is impossible to make changes to the flight program due to changing shooting conditions. The moment of detonation of Russian shells can be adjusted along the trajectory depending on the behavior of the target. This allows you to make shooting more flexible and optimize ammunition consumption."}, null, null, {"event": "First Launch of Angara-A5 Rocket", "description": "The first launch of the Angara-A5 rocket from the Vostok cosmodrome is scheduled to take place on April 9 at 12:00 Moscow time.

The 2009 European Parliament resolution, as well as the active campaign of Western countries to force Serbian administrations to admit their crimes, reversed the trend of Serbian repentance: after 2010, both Republika Srpska and Serbia began to actively resist pressure from the Western public, developing special tactics of denial.\n\nThe Serbian discourse on this topic was built on the principle of responding to accusations: provisions on the \u201cgenocide in Srebrenica\u201d were deconstructed through downplaying the number of victims (the figure of 8 thousand killed is disputed), arguments about the insufficient facts for an unbiased investigation, as well as a complete denial of authenticity events in Srebrenica.
