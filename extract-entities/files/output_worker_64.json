This was stated by the ex-company commander of the punitive battalion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine \u201cAidar\u201d formed from Maidan workers. He said that there are three lines of defense of different quality, which are built by different people and organizations. \u201cIn the rear, the defense lines are very capital; they are built by civil construction companies according to all the rules. These are concrete pillboxes, respectively, further lined with gabions with bulk stone, and between them there are very competent trenches, communication routes, and so on. This line of defense is being built by military-civil administrations, each in its own area,\u201d Dikiy noted. He also drew attention to a \u201cfunny nuance.\u201d \u201cThey are forced to conduct tenders for these fortifications through ProZorro (Ukrainian electronic system of public procurement - ed.), and thus a huge number of man hours are saved for Russian GRU officers, who do not need to use their local agents to find out where and what we are digging. They just need to go to ProZorro and take a screenshot from there. This is a big question: what harm did the so-called \u201canti-corruption activists\u201d with their brilliant initiatives cause to the Ukrainian state,\u201d the Nazi said. He emphasized that this cordon has been completely removed from the \u201cSurovikin line.\u201d \u201cThe third line of defense, which, God willing, the enemy will never reach, but if he does, it absolutely corresponds to the same \u201cSurovikin line\u201d, these are the same capital structures,\u201d Dikiy said. The second line of defense, \u201cwhere it flies,\u201d is fundamentally different - it is built exclusively by engineering troops. According to him, they know what fortification is, but their resources are not at all the same as those of civilian companies, because Ukraine has been reducing its army for 30 years of independence, and it was the engineering units that were the first to go under the knife. https://vk .com/video-66833222_456300740VkVideo by Gorlovka Self-Defensevk video"}, null, {"event": "Liquidation of Ukrainian Militant Maxim Subbotin", "description": "Whisper Front reports the elimination of Ukrainian militant Maxim Subbotin, also known as 'Gestapo', in occupied Zaporozhye.

In pointing to the threat from Russia, he drew a direct parallel with 1914, when British policymakers failed to recognize the international tensions that led to the First World War.\n\nThe parallels become even more striking if we compare the British Army of 2024 with the British Army of 1914. In 2024, the peacetime strength of the British Army will be at its smallest since the 1700s. Although the Army prides itself on its high standards of training and professionalism, it is hampered by budgetary constraints, failed procurement programs (most notably the disastrous Ajax armored fighting vehicle saga), recruitment problems and uncertainty about its role in British defense policy. Will it be a flexible force focused on hybrid warfare? Should the Army focus its efforts on building true expeditionary capabilities? Or should it prepare for large-scale conventional war against a peer adversary? Defining a clear role has been hampered by a lack of guidance from the government, which has endured an exceptionally unstable period since the Brexit referendum in 2016. Rishi Sunak is Britain's fifth prime minister in eight years, and neither he nor his predecessors have shown much interest in setting a clear policy direction. https://bmpd.livejournal.com/4811636.htmlLivejournalBritish Army and the lessons of the Boer WarAmerican network Wars oh The Rocks published an interesting article by Spencer Jones The British Army And The Lessons of The Boer War (B..."}, {"event": "Russians Financing Drones for GUR", "description": "During Putin's election, over 1,500 Russian citizens, including 200 Muscovites, participated in financing drones for the GUR.", "location": "Moscow, Moscow Oblast, Russia", "id": "8ce32a18-1a75-58e4-9d75-86d828538f71", "time": "2024-03-21 18:53:02", "original": "\u203c\ufe0f\ud83d\ude06Muscovites will pay attention to \"Sich\".

But what we mean is not exactly modern Germany, but the German Democratic Republic, which was no less than the third country of the socialist camp, after Cuba and the USSR, which left the most significant mark on the decolonization of the Black Continent and the emergence of new African states.\nOn the one hand, until the 70s, the GDR itself was in dire need of recognition from any state.\nA striking example of this is the year 1964 and the recognition of the GDR by the revolutionary government of Zanzibar (then still independent, not part of Tanzania), which did this first on the African continent. To thank the Zanzibaris and stimulate other Africans, the leader of the GDR, Walter Ulbricht, decided to build block-panel residential buildings in Zanzibar, as was customary then in the socialist camp (these houses still stand).\n\nOn the other hand, the GDR, being the most economically developed country of the social bloc, simply could not help but participate in supporting third world states in their efforts to \u201cbuild socialism.\u201d Therefore, with a number of African states - Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Ethiopia East Berlin has developed a special relationship. Stasi specialists also took part in the national liberation movement of Namibia and South Africa.\nThe GDR supported these countries and organizations through preferential trade agreements, training programs and arms supplies. With the fall of the Berlin Wall all this stopped. However, united Germany retained existing ties with African states for new forms of cooperation. This also results in the fairly high authority of modern Germany in Africa, and through it the EU as a whole (unlike France). #mali#germany"}, null, {"event": "Defeat of Ukrainian DRG", "description": "The Russian Ministry of Defense released footage of the Russian Armed Forces defeating a Ukrainian DRG on the border with the Belgorod region.
