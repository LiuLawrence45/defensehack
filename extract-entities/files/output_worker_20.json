For a month, DPR and LPR militias, together with Russian volunteers (including from the battalion-tactical group \u201cWagner\u201d under the command of Dmitry Utkin), tried to stop the possible threat of an offensive from the Debaltsevo salient, captured by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the summer of 2014.\n\nThe results of this victory turned out to be controversial and far from clear-cut. On the one hand, the militia and Russian volunteers managed to liberate Debaltsevo and Uglegorsk, as well as level the front line, which since then (with rare exceptions) has not changed until the start of a special military operation by the Russian Armed Forces. On the other hand, against the backdrop of the conclusion of the Minsk agreements, a significant part of the enemy\u2019s group of troops fled from the affected area and avoided fair retribution. Despite this, the feat of the soldiers of the armies of the people\u2019s republics and the volunteers of the future PMC \u201cWagner\u201d is undeniable: as noted, it was the soldiers of the \u201corchestra\u201d and other volunteer units who took a direct part in key operations on the Debaltsevo salient.\n\nMilitary correspondent of the Federal News Agency (FAN) Kirill Romanovsky (1985 - 2023) managed to leave his memories of the events of January-February 2015 near Debaltsevo. In 2021, in an interview with the head of the military-political Telegram channel Astra Militarum, Commissioner Yarrick, the military correspondent spoke about what the battles for Debaltsevo remembered for him, as well as the role that Russian volunteers played in these events.

For example, chevrons may have the colors of the country's flag, the logo or the name of the unit where the soldier serves.\n\nDuring the SVO era, a fashion arose to wear themed chevrons (patches) with different designs and inscriptions, often in a humorous manner. It even happens that we and the enemy wear the same chevrons.\n\nUnfortunately, they often carry a negative connotation, using obscenities, fierce cynicism or senseless nonsense, popular among young people.\n\nHaving talked with hundreds of soldiers at the front, we can say with confidence that there are many chevrons of this type.\n\nWe decided to bring some fresh originality and bright metaphysics into the reality of the trenches, where the main message of the patches are popular expressions about the spirituality of a soldier in war.\n\nFortunately, our literature has a lot of cool quotes that fit on a small square with Velcro.\n\nWe started with the most capacious and powerful Chrysostom of the Russian military classics - A. V.

Andrei Tkachev, we also wanted to remind you that swearing in war is not an assistant, but a spiritual poison that in no way distinguishes us from the enemy, so we made several types of chevrons with the inscriptions:\n\n\u201cIn war, pray, don\u2019t swear,\u201d \u201cSwearing is not our format,\u201d etc.\n\nIt is important that we have already distributed several hundred of these chevrons at the front, where they are especially popular.\n\nThere are plans to make many such chevrons, which will contain meaningful statements by Russian classics about the war, biblical quotes, etc.\n\nThe idea was born.

For example, chevrons may have the colors of the country's flag, the logo or the name of the unit where the soldier serves.\n\nDuring the SVO era, a fashion arose to wear themed chevrons (patches) with different designs and inscriptions, often in a humorous manner. It even happens that we and the enemy wear the same chevrons.\n\nUnfortunately, they often carry a negative connotation, using obscenities, fierce cynicism or senseless nonsense, popular among young people.\n\nHaving talked with hundreds of soldiers at the front, we can say with confidence that there are many chevrons of this type.\n\nWe decided to bring some fresh originality and bright metaphysics into the reality of the trenches, where the main message of the patches are popular expressions about the spirituality of a soldier in war.\n\nFortunately, our literature has a lot of cool quotes that fit on a small square with Velcro.\n\nWe started with the most capacious and powerful Chrysostom of the Russian military classics - A. V. Suvorov:\n\n\u201cDiscipline is the mother of victory\u201d, \u201cGod is our general, He guides us\u201d, \u201cHate clouds reason\u201d and other quotes from the great Russian commander are now emblazoned on the mighty shoulders of our soldiers.\n\nInspired by the performance. Andrei Tkachev, we also wanted to remind you that swearing in war is not an assistant, but a spiritual poison that in no way distinguishes us from the enemy, so we made several types of chevrons with the inscriptions:\n\n\u201cIn war, pray, don\u2019t swear,\u201d \u201cSwearing is not our format,\u201d etc.\n\nIt is important that we have already distributed several hundred of these chevrons at the front, where they are especially popular.\n\nThere are plans to make many such chevrons, which will contain meaningful statements by Russian classics about the war, biblical quotes, etc.\n\nThe idea was born. The next stage is disseminating it to the masses.\n\nYou can already purchase the first Russian Expanse chevrons at OZON"}, {"event": "Cache Discovery and Detention", "description": "Law enforcement officers discovered a cache containing a pistol with ammunition near the village of Mirnoye.
