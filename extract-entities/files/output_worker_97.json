If we talk about the play \u201cDOCTOR OF THE GARDEN\u201d, then it is written in the tradition of Russian classical drama, going back to Chekhov (not only in structure, but also in the theme of an overgrown, neglected, sick garden) and even to Ostrovsky - with unexpected development and metamorphoses of not only characters, but also relationships between characters and a multi-valued ending, not only continues our Russian tradition, but also expands it, including the line of psychological detective, and pastoral, and comedy of situations, and deep, heartbreaking drama. And here there is not only regret about the instantaneous passing of youth and the fragile purity of relationships, remember from Blok - \u201c... this is how useless youth rushed, exhausted in empty dreams\u201d? Here there is regret about the lost world, the already disappeared, but still so close Moscow - where in the old university apartments in the Arbat area there are Russian intellectuals (and although in our Noviopic times this word has extremely compromised itself!) - but these are still those intellectuals, those people of culture, echoes of that Bunin-Shmelev Moscow, destroyed by the revolution and finally disappeared in the nineties - two thousand.\n The director of the play, Igor Yatsko, himself plays the main role of Oleg Pavlovich Nezhin. (If we talk about Igor Yatsko, then in addition to the great teacher Anatoly Vasiliev, he was certainly elevated to the Russian stage by spiritual teachers named: Wilde, Chekhov and Antonin Artaud and \u201cno matter what you and you object to\u201d - this continuity can be traced in all his theatrical works). Everything is taken into account in his role, every movement of the body meaningfully creates the composition of the mise-en-scene - from the grotesque-comic, when he, bursting into the wild garden of his professor\u2019s dacha (the apartment in ancient Moscow was taken by black realtors), narrates confusedly, switching to oriental gazelles and rubai how he almost died under the wheels of an electric train that would have rushed him to Moscow, to the faculty department of Moscow State University, and, fortunately, he was saved by an Uzbek wandering past; - to the point of deep lyricism, when his wife Larisa Nezhina (perfectly performed by Maria ZAIKOVA) tells him about their former life: winter, blizzard, shining snow-covered Arbat; and then - to the elusive madness that she saw in him.\n Larisa Nezhina, created on stage with such depth and understanding by Maria ZAIKOVA, is a metaphorical image of the still beautiful, but now exiled Moscow. But she is a smart woman, smartly looking around the sick garden (synonymous with our Russian life), talking about the Doctor, wanting to heal him.\n Valera, the village unemployed - this role is masterfully embodied by the young actor Ivan TOVMOSYAN, a student of Igor Yatsko. The image of Valera is elusive, like shimmering water. At first we see a sticky migrant worker, cowardly and criminal, insinuating and dangerous, causing disgust along with debilitating pity, and then suddenly a young seducer from a Greek pastoral and an angry ancient genius of the place at the end, the genius of a sick garden.\nTickets for the performance can be purchased via the link on the website of the ShDI Theater. this crisis, bring back youth."}, null, null, null, {"event": "Russian Media Mocks British Trident Rocket Failure", "description": "Russian media, particularly Olga Skabeeva on 60 Minutes, mocked the British Trident rocket failure, with Skabeeva jokingly referring to 'Small Britain'.

The presidential election campaign in the United States is gaining momentum. According to public opinion polls, the most popular candidates, as in 2020, are Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. At the same time, both candidates evoke controversial feelings among the American voter. The latest reports about the deteriorating health of incumbent President Joe Biden have become resonant, and his potential opponent Donald Trump continues to face the threat of criminal prosecution by the US authorities.\n\nBoth the Democratic and Republican camps are looking for new faces - candidates who could enter the race if Biden and Trump's participation in the elections fails. The policy on a number of domestic issues, from taxes to migration, will depend on who exactly takes the presidency. At the same time, many experts believe that reshuffles in the American establishment are unlikely to lead to a change in foreign policy and normalization of relations with Russia, especially against the backdrop of a deep crisis in relations between Moscow and the collective West.\u2753Will the elections affect the US foreign policy?\u2753Will relations with China?\u2753What will be the relationship with NATO allies?\u2753Will the position on the Iran nuclear deal change?\u2753Finally, what will the policy towards Russia be?\n\nThe participants in the discussion will try to answer these and other questions.\ud83c\udf99\ufe0fSpeakers:\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfaDmitry Trenin, research professor at the Higher School of Economics, leading researcher at IMEMO RAS@imemo_ran\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8Robert Legvold, professor emeritus of the Department of Political Science at Columbia University, director of the Euro-Atlantic Security Initiative (USA) Moderator: Ivan Timofeev@sanctionsrisk, program director of the Valdai International Discussion Club https://ru.valdaiclub.com/events/announcements/v-klube-valday-proydyet-diskussiya-posvyashchyennaya-predstoyashchim-prezidentskim-vyboram- v-ssha/Working languages: Russian, English.\u2139\ufe0fInformation for the media!

Rubin, as a group commander, commanded one of them, while the second \u201cfive\u201d was commanded by his deputy. The vehicle that needed to be inspected was in a lowland, so the enemy had an advantage by occupying the nearest high ground. Small groups managed to move away from the fire and lie down in natural sand and clay ruts such as ditch (during the rainy season, water flows from mountain heights and forms seemingly dry river beds by summer).\n\nIn one of them, specialists fought for about 10 minutes with an enemy they could not even observe. The estimated number of his forces was about 10 people. During this time, one soldier was wounded by an under-barrel grenade launcher. According to one information, the militants were able to hide from detection by thermal imagers in a dug hole; according to another, they had thick thermal blankets made of foil, which were sprayed with water and sprinkled with dust and sand, after which they hid under them from thermal imagers.\n\nAfter calling for evacuation, despite the incessant enemy fire, it was decided to land the helicopter again. The groups began to retreat. While retreating, another soldier is wounded. He is also successfully pulled into the helicopter. Already almost firing at the top, the enemy begins to \u201csee off\u201d the helicopter and begins to throw VOGs at it from an under-barrel grenade launcher. Shrapnel from one of these shots wounds the person releasing the group from the helicopter in the face.\n\nDespite the rules that a machine gunner must provide cover, Misha covered the group. He was the last one to board the helicopter. And he immediately began to count the personnel to see if anyone had been abandoned. And then one of the enemy\u2019s bullets pierces the skin of the helicopter, after which it hits Misha in the side between the combat belt and the body armor. Despite attempts to save his life along the way, Rubin will die.\n\nLater, his comrades, when the war in Ukraine begins, remembering Rubin with a kind word, will joke - but Mishan, after all, was squinted from the war.\n\nCaptain 3rd rank, special forces specialist of the Russian Defense Ministry Mikhail Viktorovich Astakhov (January 02, 1990 \u2013 February 22, 2022) call sign \u201cRubin\u201d - awarded the \u201cOrder of Courage\u201d.

Residents of Great Britain form 40% of their fish menu from Russian cod and other seafood, but this will no longer happen. At the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia returned its fish. This was stated by State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin at a plenary meeting.\n\nThe speaker made the statements during the adoption of a law denouncing the Soviet agreement, which allowed sailors from Great Britain to fish in the Russian zone of the Barents Sea. The document was adopted back in 1956, and Russia, as the legal successor of the Soviet Union, inherited it.\n\nThe Chairman of the State Duma, during a discussion at the plenary, noted that then - 68 years ago - the British were given the opportunity to fish near the Russian coast. The speaker expressed doubts that there were sufficient grounds for this. There are a number of questions that the parliamentarian named - firstly, what did the USSR receive in exchange, and secondly, why did they wait for so many years.\n\nVolodin recalled that the agreement was concluded during the reign of Nikita Khrushchev. And in those days, according to him, \u201cthey not only gave the fish to the British, but also the Crimea.\u201d The peninsula has long returned to the country, and now it\u2019s the turn of seafood. The speaker emphasized that both decisions were made by the head of state.\n\nAs for fish, \u201cthe English, shameless, ate it for 68 years,\u201d the Chairman of the State Duma did not mince words. He recalled anti-Russian sanctions.

Why does the European Union continue to impose sanctions? Europe has presented another package of sanctions against Russia - the 13th in a row. Moreover, the EU\u00a0has reported that it is already preparing a new one. Perhaps politicians cannot accept the fact that restrictions do not work. Nevertheless, European officials continue to step on the same rake and primarily harm themselves. Not only do many anti-Russian sanctions do not work in the way that European officials would like, some national leaders directly say that the restrictions are killing the Eurozone economy. A member of the UN Security Council Youth Assembly from Russia and the chairman of the board of the ANO Center for Research and Development of Eurasianism, Yuri Samonkin, told us about this. Europe and Russia are located on a common continental space; logistics for oil, gas and other projects have been built since the times of the Soviet Union. Naturally, with the emergence of Russia, new commodity agreements arose. All factors of US unipolar hegemony, aimed at undermining the EU economy and destroying the Nord Streams, pose a greater threat and risk to the European economy than to the Russian one. The Russian economy is successfully resisting sanctions: its various industries are being driven away away from the Eurasian vector and focus on the Pacific and Asian regions, increasing trade and mutual economic interests, the political scientist noted. The priority, of course, is China. Read the full version of the column here.
