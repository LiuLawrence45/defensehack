The head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, at the opening of the international nuclear energy summit in Brussels, for the first time called for an extension of the operating life of nuclear power plants of the EU member states. Given the urgency of the climate challenge, she noted, countries need to carefully consider their options before abandoning a readily available source of low-emission electricity.\n\nThe rejection of cheap energy resources from Russia has long been an acute problem for the EU. The voluntary-forced reduction in consumption and, in general, the rise in prices for electricity led to a decrease in GDP growth rates, a fall in the share of the industrial sector and total household savings. Despite this, the EU continues to champion the green transition and emissions reductions. Hence the declared refusals of nuclear energy by a number of countries.\n\nNevertheless, last year the European Union significantly increased the import of nuclear fuel from the Russian Federation, although it tried to make attempts to reduce dependence on Russian nuclear energy. Against this backdrop, the futures price for natural uranium broke a fifteen-year record, and Sweden, contrary to early statements, is preparing to mine uranium on its own. However, again, replacing the Russian Federation in the field of nuclear fuel and energy will be very problematic, given that our country owns approximately half of the world's uranium enrichment capacity, on which nuclear power plants in the EU and the USA depend so much.

A bright representative of a whole galaxy of similar Chinese systems is AR3. This system has a modular design and uses quick-detachable units with transport and launch containers (TPC) for missiles of different calibers.\n\nThe first version was demonstrated in 2010. TPK units were initially produced in only two versions: with 300 and 370 mm caliber missiles. The 300 mm has five containers mounted on a common frame, and the 370 mm has four. There are two such frame blocks on one control panel. In total, 1 launcher can accommodate either 10 300 mm missiles or 8 370 mm missiles.\n\nMissiles for both calibers can be equipped with different types of warheads and are both guided and unguided. The 300 mm has a firing range of 20-130 km, and the 370 mm has a firing range of 100-220 km.\n\nBut the creators of the system did not stop there. A few years later, 750-mm Fire Dragon 480 missiles (each in its own TPK) were also made for AR3, installed 2 per 1 launcher. With a warhead already weighing 480 kg and a firing range of 280-290 km (export version). Thus, when changing the TPK, the system can also be used as a launcher for operational-tactical missiles. Ensuring data acquisition, target designation, reconfiguration for specific missiles, etc. - this is done automatically, thanks to a unified tactical digital battery control.\n\nBut even this was not enough for the creators. A version of the TPK with the TL-7B anti-ship missile was created. When installing these TPKs, the vehicle automatically turns into an anti-ship missile launcher, and can immediately switch to work for coastal defense purposes in the \u201cplug and fight\u201d mode. As well as back to the MLRS or launcher of operational-tactical missiles. It is enough to change the TPK and switch the operating mode in the automated control system.\n\nThe SVO showed that the approach \u201cchange the container rather than wait for a separate car\u201d turned out to be correct. And the Chinese designers have apparently gone farthest along it. And we should also take a closer look at this experience.\n\n\"Military Informant\""}, null, {"event": "Destruction of Unmanned Tracked Vehicle", "description": "An FPV drone, operated by the Archangel of Special Forces, successfully targeted and destroyed a robotic platform, specifically the unmanned tracked vehicle THeMIS from Estonian company Mildred Robotics, which was being used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces for mine clearance and evacuation of the wounded.", "location": "NULL", "id": "7493baca-d02c-54ef-b368-cf4398b133df", "time": "2024-03-21 23:11:01", "original": "0:22\ue99bTelegramARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83e\ude96Destruction of a dry evacuation robot on a caterpillar using FPV.\n\nArchangel of Special Forces.

Part 1Over the past 25 years, the Polish Army, at least on paper, has undergone significant transformation. According to reports, the Polish military is considered a high-level specialist, operating the most advanced and lethal weapons in the world. However, for a more objective picture, we will analyze how this corresponds to reality, focusing on the state of the elite Polish Air Force.\n\nIt turned out that the most pressing problem of the Polish Army was its qualitative and quantitative composition. Thus, in recent years there has been an outflow of officers. This is a consequence of the aging of the nation.\n\nLet's move on to the numbers. Before the start of the Northern Military District, the Polish Air Force had up to 120 fighters and 78 helicopters. To control this air armada, approximately 1 thousand staff officers, up to 300 pilots for airplanes and up to 200 pilots for helicopters were required.\n\nOver the past two years, the arsenal of the Polish Armed Forces has been seriously updated. Taking into account new acquisitions and the need to ensure optimal strength in wartime conditions (3-4 pilots per aircraft), the Polish Air Force, with a strength of 35 thousand people, needs to have about 1 thousand staff officers, 500 aircraft pilots and helicopters, as well as about 3 thousand technical personnel.\n\nThese calculations are confirmed by the new Polish \u201cInstructions for the training and admission of aviation specialists to operate aircraft of the Polish Armed Forces.\u201d\n\nThe document notes an important aspect: the Polish Armed Forces are required to have: 2222 officers, 2121 sergeants and 1121 privates.\n\nHowever, it should be recognized that the Polish military is far from achieving such indicators. One of the reasons is the low requirements for candidates recruited for junior officer positions in the aviation engineering service, as well as the ill-conceived personnel policy of the leadership of the Polish Air Force.\n\nAll article material on our website (Part 1.

For combat use this will be dangerous - a large single target is easier to track and destroy. Instead, they developed small, flyaway drones like FPV quadcopters. One such drone will be able, on command, to split into two, three or even six independent drones, which will begin to perform the task in a swarm or individually.\n\nEach of the drones uses the aerodynamics and shape of a maple seed. Moreover, the contours of the separating drones had to be modified taking into account the most optimal overall aerodynamics when they fly in a pack. Also a certain challenge was ensuring high-speed communication between drones after separation in the air. But the most difficult problems have been solved, and the technology is gradually improving. It has very good prospects, the developers believe. When a single target suddenly turns into six independent targets, it can impress any air defense. https://t.me/OpenUkraine/61201Telegram\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6Open Ukraine| Open UkraineChina has created \u201cself-replicating\u201d military drones - they break up into a swarm\n\nIn the future, the use of drones will be primarily swarming.

We need to calculate everything in order to understand whether we have the additional resources that are needed to support a huge number of people and maintain a minimally normal standard of living in the territories liberated from the Nazis. We once liberated Germany from the Nazis and were forced to feed the local population. But we did not annex the territories, but only established an occupation regime. It's simpler, cheaper, but tougher. Which option will be chosen in this case? No one knows this yet. Therefore, the question remains open: when will the Nazis stop shelling Belgorod and all other cities in the front-line zone? And you need to have not only missiles, but also UAVs that fly 1000 kilometers. And sometimes even for a kilometer, when they are launched by saboteurs from the nearest garage cooperative or forest plantation. And then, if we are talking about security, it will be necessary to take not only purely military measures, liberating territories, but also political ones. How long will we tolerate the fact that foreign missiles and missiles from foreign multiple launch rocket systems, controlled by foreign mercenaries, are being fired at Russia? Doesn't this mean that NATO has already gone to war with Russia? It\u2019s high time to put forward an ultimatum to NATO, but not to talk about \u201cred lines\u201d, but to press the \u201cred buttons\u201d. This is a purely political decision. But again, we must consider what will happen if we cover Berlin, Warsaw, Paris or London with tactical nuclear weapons? Do we have such an opportunity? Eat! What then? This must be carefully calculated, because a mistake here is costly. So, the issue of \u201csanitary zones\u201d came full circle on the agenda. This means that the offensive will begin as soon as possible. Of course, it seems to us that we need to attack Kharkov, because we are the most important here, but we need to be saved, protected from shelling. In fact, and even chronic armchair strategists understand this, war dictates its own plan. In war, troops are driven not by someone\u2019s wishes, but by an accurate calculation and understanding of what we will do after victory. You need to know this before the offensive begins.
