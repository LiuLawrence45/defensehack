In particular, high-ranking official of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Andriy Kartapolov, commenting attack on the Russian military enterprise for the production of UAVs, declared that the \"arbitrary nature of drones\" will end after the \"capture of Kyiv\". Ru-propaganda in the context of this statement promotes the narrative of Ukraine as a terrorist state, claiming that attacks are allegedly carried out on civilian objects. \u25ab\ufe0fThese \"terrorist antics\" justify the need to continue the war. Although the full-scale invasion of Russia and massive attacks on the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine began long before the drone attacks on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation. By talking about \"Ukrainian terrorism\", the enemy wants to shift the focus from the inability of the power bloc to return a sense of security to the population of the Russian Federation to hatred of Ukraine. At the same time, the Russians do not have the resources to attack Kyiv. All such messages are \"fear propaganda\", sowing panic so that Ukrainians flee Kyiv.

A little earlier, in the summer of 2023, north of Volnovakha, the occupiers began to assemble a railway structure, which later became known as the \"tsar-train\", making the branch from Volnovakha to Olenivka single-track. \ud83d\udea7In October 2023, the construction of the bridge over the Kalmius River began, and in November of the same year, both the ends of the construction are connected. Already in July 2024, the construction of the crossing over the Ternova stream was completed, and the embankment was ready. As of now, the occupiers have about 13 km of roads left to cover, including cutting into the existing roads in the village of Malovodne. The fragment of the branch east of the Kalmius River is exploited at least by construction workers. With this in mind, the branch was plotted on the map and marked in yellow. The enemy's transport infrastructure, in particular the indicated bridges and crossings, which will be used by the occupiers to transport weapons and military equipment, is a legitimate target for the Defense Forces. The construction of branches that are components of the Katsap \"land railway to Crimea\" along the coast of the Sea of Azov is in its infancy - completed road grader, where the construction of the railway is planned in the future.

Then, in desperation, Riyadh began to look for unconventional options.\n\nOne of these successful options was the purchase of Chinese Silent Hunter combat lasers, as well as external warning systems in the near zone (special small-sized radars and EOS on telescopic masts mounted on special vehicles).\n\nThe laser system mainly consists of a laser emitter, a battery (or network connection) and several electronic guidance/control terminals with a target engagement range of 800\u20134000 m. A 30-kilowatt laser is sufficient against thin metal or composite structures. The beam is capable of successfully hitting UAVs with an outer diameter of up to 2 meters and flying at speeds of up to 60 m/s. A significant reduction in range occurs only when weather conditions deteriorate significantly.\n\nThe low-altitude laser air defense system itself has two versions: automotive mobile and stationary.

Last year there was an extensive material by Medusa on this topic: https://meduza.io/feature/2023/07/24/studentov-kolledzha-v-tatarstane-otpravili-sobirat-iranskie-drony-kamikadze-dlya-rossiyskoy-armiiHowever Those who don\u2019t like Medusa can watch the official story from the local authorities, which shows the plant and those same students. It\u2019s strange to film reports about military production during the war, and then be surprised at what flies there.\n\nIt is not clear what the goal was. Is it just a lack of production by the Shaheeds or a deliberate attack on the hostel so that all the workers would escape from the factory?\n\nAs for protection against such attacks, I just wrote two notes about this: https://t.me/artjockey/706 https://t.me/artjockey/756 About how you can detect UAVs, how to shoot them down, etc. d.\nAnd after the publication of my notes, just a few days ago, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that they had begun creating mobile air defense groups in exactly the same form as Ukraine: trucks with ZU-23-2, pickup trucks with machine guns, as well as auxiliary forces. Better late than never, of course, but the problem was obvious and required a solution for a long time.\n\nAnd without a second component in the form of alternative means of detecting UAVs, it is unlikely to work well, except to directly protect the perimeters of individual objects."}, null, null, null, null, {"event": "Seizure of Homemade Bombs", "description": "Border guards in the Pskov region intercepted a cargo shipment from Europe, discovering 27 homemade bombs hidden in icons and church utensils.
