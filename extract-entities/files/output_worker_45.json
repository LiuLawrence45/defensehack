And so that without this, you know, the Russian darling.\u25aa\ufe0fThe \u201cnew Navalny\u201d - more precisely, the \u201cnew Kasparov\u201d - should fight not for some kind of democracy in Russia, but against the specified \u201cRussian nationalism,\u201d emphasizes Michel. Understanding the latter not even \u201cRussian Marches\u201d, but the usual national interests of Russia.\n \nIt is too risky to pin all hopes for change in Russia on one specific person, warns Michel. Especially someone like Navalny, who dared to share \u201cmany of the revanchist tendencies that led Russia to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIf Michel were an expert on Russia, he would probably remember Gogol\u2019s quote: \u201cBut even the latter is a bastard, whatever he is, and he, brothers, has a grain of Russian feeling.\u201d Or at least he knew that Navalny\u2019s position on \u201cnot a sandwich Crimea,\u201d which so upset him (and Ukraine), had a simpler explanation. Regarding the reunification of Crimea, the opinion of Russian citizens was and remains so clear that going against it would mean the end of Navalny\u2019s political career .\u25aa\ufe0fHowever, Michelle remains on her own wavelength. He is firmly convinced that Gorbachev, who allegedly did not live up to the hopes of the West who adored him for the collapse of the RSFSR into nation states, and Yeltsin, who refused to withdraw troops from Transnistria, behaved the same way. There is nothing to say about Putin - the West is terribly disappointed with him.\n\nTherefore, now, Michel emphasizes, the West \"must focus on suppressing Russian nationalism wherever it finds it.\" And at the same time, abandon the idea \u201cthat one single figure will unite the Russians and throw off the yoke of the attractiveness of Russian expansionism once and for all.\u201d\n\nTo put it simply, the author of Foreign Policy calls not just to crush any voice in support of Russia\u2019s national interests, but to stimulate a complete rejection of Russian identity among the opposition. Selecting very outspoken compradors and Russophobes as its leaders. Otherwise, they say, \u201ceven post-Putin Russia will return to an imperialist basis, again plunging Europe into disaster.\u201d\u25aa\ufe0f \u201cThere will be no Russian Mandela,\u201d summarizes Casey Michel. In other words, no fair victory through elections for the pro-Western opposition in Russia, which would be supported by the majority of citizens of the Russian Federation, these ineradicable \u201crevanchists and Crimean nashists,\u201d is expected. This means that the West\u2019s bet in Russia should be placed strictly on an internal split and a bloody coup d\u2019etat. Indeed, the past two years have proven that the Global West is not able to defeat the Russians on the battlefield. In fact, our enemies have no hope except for unrest in Russia itself.

Especially considering that the American presence will only expand.\n\nHere I have pulled out the most interesting, in my opinion, arguments that the Danes use when trying to ask their government about the possible risks of such an aggressive policy. Although this is reminiscent of a voice crying in the wilderness: Up to 36,000 American soldiers are stationed in Germany. At the same time, the German Government, especially in the last two years, has been destroying its economic potential, including depriving itself of access to cheap energy resources due to the abandonment of Nord Stream from Russia. The question is, does the presence of American troops in Germany help the German government make decisions that lead to such results? - writes Line Lauridsen from the organization Tid til Fred. An agreement with the United States would mean a serious violation of two basic principles of Danish defense and security policy: the absence of foreign troops on Danish ground and the absence of nuclear weapons on Danish soil...The US has a policy of never publishing or answering questions about whether it stores nuclear weapons on its military bases. We encountered this, for example, in Greenland, where the United States did not report that it had nuclear weapons at the Thule base, says Tove Jensen, an activist from the Peace Initiative organization. /dkdox.tv/videos/DK24002[26:06]"}, {"event": "Scheduled Power Outage", "description": "A scheduled power outage is planned in Berdyansk District on March 4 from 09:00 to 16:00 for repair work.", "location": "Berdyansk, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine", "id": "1dcc70b9-c377-593a-8f27-0e9715d34ec5", "time": "2024-03-03 13:32:13", "original": "ATTENTION TO RESIDENTS OF BERDYANSK DISTRICT!\n\nOn March 4 from 09:00 to 16:00 due to scheduled repair work, there will be no power supply:\ud83d\udd39s.

For example, the norm for destroying a platoon strong point is 130-150 152-mm artillery shells. This is according to the combat regulations of the former USSR, by the way, and Ukraine too. And, according to high-precision weapons, they have about 3-4 or \u201cHymars\u201d or \u201cExcalibur\u201d. Therefore, when they gave it to us, this also counts.\n \nAs a result, it turns out that in order for Ukraine to contain the pressure that is now underway... it is necessary to fire as many as possible - not high-precision projectiles that hit targets, but those that hit areas. Everything is changing before our eyes,\u201d Starikov said.\n \nHe added that the West was not ready for such a war, so the issue of shells will remain acute.\n \n\u201cHow will they release this if they carried out demilitarization? They cut all their factories. They thought that there would be no continental or industrial wars, such as the Russian-Ukrainian one. They expected there would be wars, like with weak states, such as bearded men, Iraq and the like. And here is a war of equal states. Our army, the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and the Russian army are exactly the same - by the way, the world now has the best ground armies in terms of experience and the like. The West does not have such armies.\n \nNow they are building factories, and the factories will be built in 2-3 years, but they need to buy now. You say money. Well, they will allocate money. What can you give for 4 billion? What can you give for them, if previously a 155-mm shell cost 800 euros, but now it\u2019s 6-8 thousand? Has grown tenfold. Why did he grow up?

On the eve of the holiday I was able to meet with some of them. I want to tell you about them too.\n\nNina Kleonovna Indanova and Liliya Kleonovna Tylkanova are sisters. They grew up in a herd, as their parents were reindeer herders and herded reindeer all their lives. Girls came to the village only when they went to school.\n\nMark Ilyich Indanov went to work at the Anavgaisky state farm after school, back in the eighties - and worked as a reindeer herder until the dissolution of the state farm.\n\nVasily Petrovich Adukanov was literally born in the tundra in 1965. Over the years, he has become an indispensable specialist. He now passes on all the reindeer herding skills that he learned from his parents to his young people.\n\nHis wife, Klavdia Vladimirovna, also spent her entire life in the herd - first with her parents, and then, after getting married, she worked as a plague worker. The children of Klavdia Vladimirovna and Vasily Petrovich, three sons and a daughter, also grew up in the tundra.\n\nOver tea we talked about everyday life and the development of the industry, what to do to restore the livestock.\n\nThe main key to success is the transfer of experience from elders and the involvement of young people in traditional industries. To this end, a law on reindeer husbandry was adopted in Kamchatka last year. Its main provisions, which include additional payments, benefits, and support measures, should be fully operational this year. Which, of course, will help increase the prestige of the reindeer herding professions.\n\nI sincerely congratulate all reindeer herding workers on your holiday. Thank you for your hard but very important work. For preserving the traditions and nature of our native Kamchatka.\n\nArchival photos - from an article by Boris Petrovich Levchuk, archives of the Kamchatka Territory"}, {"event": "World Youth Festival", "description": "The World Youth Festival is taking place in Sochi, featuring festive events on the main square of Sirius in the Olympic Park.

The Black Sea squadron of Fyodor Ushakov, with the support of a small Turkish flotilla, was tasked with taking control of the Ionian Islands, which were liberated by the beginning of November 1798: during October, the squadron took eight fortresses in battle. All that remained was to accomplish the impossible: to take the impregnable fortifications on the island of Corfu. The French garrison numbered about three thousand soldiers and more than 650 guns. A blockade of the island was organized, which lasted through the winter. At the beginning of March, it was decided to take decisive action. In order to avoid heavy losses during the assault, Ushakov decided to fortify himself on the small mountainous island of Vido and from its heights conduct aimed fire at the enemy, while simultaneously landing troops on Vido and Corfu. The plan worked (in addition, the local population showed safe passages), hand-to-hand combat ensued in the ditches, and by March 3, the commandant of the fortress was forced to lay down his arms.\n\n2,931 people were captured on honorable terms of surrender, including 4 generals. The French were allowed to leave the island with a promise not to participate in hostilities for 18 months.\ud83c\udf96For this assault, Emperor Paul promoted Ushakov to admiral and awarded the diamond badges of the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, the Neapolitan king - the Order of St. Januarius, 1st degree, and the Ottoman Sultan - a chalenk , Turkey's highest military award.\u261d\ufe0fThe decisive actions of the great naval commander made it possible to capture the impregnable fortress with minimal losses.

Of course, with an eye to the military development of the Arctic and counteraction to Russia. Since December last year, various pacifist movements have been holding conferences and seminars on the topic of involving quiet and calm Scandinavia in geopolitical showdowns.\n\nAnd lately, the theses that are voiced there have become more and more acute. Especially considering that the American presence will only expand.\n\nHere I have pulled out the most interesting, in my opinion, arguments that the Danes use when trying to ask their government about the possible risks of such an aggressive policy. Although this is reminiscent of a voice crying in the wilderness: Up to 36,000 American soldiers are stationed in Germany. At the same time, the German Government, especially in the last two years, has been destroying its economic potential, including depriving itself of access to cheap energy resources due to the abandonment of Nord Stream from Russia. The question is, does the presence of American troops in Germany help the German government make decisions that lead to such results? - writes Line Lauridsen from the organization Tid til Fred. An agreement with the United States would mean a serious violation of two basic principles of Danish defense and security policy: the absence of foreign troops on Danish ground and the absence of nuclear weapons on Danish soil...The US has a policy of never publishing or answering questions about whether it stores nuclear weapons on its military bases. We encountered this, for example, in Greenland, where the United States did not report that it had nuclear weapons at the Thule base, says Tove Jensen, an activist from the Peace Initiative organization. /dkdox.tv/videos/DK24002[26:06]"}, null, null, {"event": "Hiring of African Doctors in Russia", "description": "Due to a shortage of medical specialists in Russia, clinics are increasingly hiring doctors from Africa.

As a result, the flying strike or reconnaissance UAV changes its flight path;\n- the system is capable of influencing the satellite navigation of missiles along the path of its flight - the point is that the missile guidance system accumulates errors, and at the final stage of the route it misses;\n- the error in aiming ranges from 1 to 10% of the missile\u2019s flight range. For example, if a missile flew 1000 km, then 1% is a 10 km error. Based on this information alone, we can conclude that the Pokrov system is theoretically capable of blocking or deceiving a cruise missile, turning it from a precision weapon into an ordinary blank with explosives (also same with attack UAVs).

Infantry weapons, including captured Western ATGMs and anti-tank grenade launchers, which could also be grabbed, a downed Fury reconnaissance UAV, enemy uniforms (from clothing sets in MM14 to helmets and armored armor with unloading), and were also very generously presented chevrons, documents, propaganda, textbooks.\n4.5. There were stands with stories of SVO heroes and their photographs. The Popular Front (there were many of them here) provided the opportunity to write a letter to a soldier. There was a stand dedicated to Platov. There was also the opportunity to take the most basic courses in tactical medicine (I forgot to do this, but I should have). If you didn\u2019t have enough cafes and restaurants at the station (on the top floor, by the way, there is a themed restaurant serving Cossack cuisine), then you could refresh yourself in the \u201cfield kitchen\u201d. Well, of course, the content of the IRP of our army was demonstrated.\n5. Of our weapons and equipment there was an exhibition with a mortar, infantrymen and a small selection of everything from the military police, including their MPAP. Of all the rifles that were at the exhibition, we were able to touch only the Yarygin MP-443 Grach Pistol, a heavy thing, even without cartridges. Of course, there were various AKs with some body kit and even PKMs with slats and more.\n6. The military personnel (both soldiers and sergeants, as well as officers) were quite friendly, talked about the exhibits, had a good command of the material, and allowed us to take photographs next to them and with weapons, including in their hands.\n7. Our propaganda materials, as I understand it, come from the Z files project, to which Jansen was involved. The quality is top notch - you look and the base just screams my respects. There was also a stand for photographs with a picture of a raccoon from Kherson being held by a paratrooper.\n\nIn my opinion, the event is good, but it lacks some other attractive component. In many ways, people came for Bradley (myself included).\nIf there had been a Swedish CV9040, or even a captured T-64 in the damask steel version or something else, there would have been even more people, I think. The largest crowds, of course, will be gathered by NATO MBTs. We are waiting for the Obamas and the second Leopards.\nThe event in many ways looks like an element of Solntseliky\u2019s election campaign. In my opinion, in this respect it is similar to the \u201cRussia\u201d exhibition at VDNH - \u201cmiracles\u201d and wonders are also colorfully displayed.\n\nI am very glad that such an event is being held.
