Why.\n\nIt's not all about the production, but about the medium. The fact is that right now we do not have carriers of this bomb. Our Tu-95MSM (first photo) after modernization cannot carry it and it simply does not make sense to carry out another expensive modernization of the aircraft for it. In addition, no one will risk a huge, slow-moving strategist near the front line, which, moreover, is not capable of soaring up like a candle before using it.\n\nThe fact that today we only use FAB-250,500,1500 is due to the fact that these are the bombs that our front-line fighters and bombers can lift to the maximum (Su-34, second photo). They won\u2019t be able to lift FAB-3000, much less FAB-5000.\n\nThey can only be lifted by Tu-22M3 strategic bombers (third photo), which, by the way, unlike their other brothers, are just capable of launching an attack at low altitude, soaring sharply upward and dropping their \u201cgifts\u201d.

Russian oil will certainly revive the North Korean economy, which now exists in conditions of international isolation. After the fall of the Soviet bloc, North Korea was one of the few socialist countries to retain its communist regime. The DPRK authorities have focused on consolidating society and the army in the new conditions. The modern ideology of the DPRK is called Juche - Songun, where Juche can be translated as \u201cself-reliance\u201d, and Songun denotes a policy where the army comes first in the political hierarchy. One of the mottos of North Korean society is \u201cWe do not envy anyone in the world.\u201d\n\nAfter the fall of the USSR, North Korea had a difficult time; the DPRK was left to support only China on the same scale. This reformatting of economic relations was not without casualties. During the \u201cDifficult March\u201d - this is how North Korean propaganda, prone to pathos and sublime pathos, calls this difficult period for the country - according to one estimate, about 200 thousand Koreans died from hunger and related diseases.\n\nAnd the DPRK has adjusted to the conditions of a closed economy. Many hydroelectric power stations were built, which solved the energy supply problem, agricultural programs were implemented, which solved the problem of hunger, and housing construction programs were implemented. Not to say, people in North Korea live richly, but they live with dignity and order. And they do not envy anyone.\n\nOne can imagine what an impetus the supply of Russian oil will give to the DPRK economy if North Korea, in fact, under conditions of a complete blockade, retained its industry and its independence. Moreover, it created its own nuclear bomb, which became the basis for security and independence.\n\nAnd such cooperation is beneficial for Russia.

But there may be several explanations for this: 1. The situation at the front is truly critical for Ukraine. To an outside observer, it may not seem that way. But the Ukrainian command has accurate data about its ability to defend further, about its own and Russian reserves. That is, Zelensky may know that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have practically no forces left to restrain Russia, and is sounding the alarm;\n 2. The situation is not so critical, but Ukraine is \u201cpressing on pity\u201d to extract help from the US Congress;\n 3. The situation is not catastrophic, but the trend in Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend itself and receive Western support is negative.

The outcome of the entire war will depend on his success. It is quite possible that we will guess everything so that the culmination of the offensive will fall around the end of Zelensky\u2019s term in office on May 20. It is possible that in this case the President of Ukraine will be overthrown, and we will be able to agree on an end to the war without further bloodshed.

Their scheme involved collaborating with tax service and law enforcement officials to seize and sell off company assets.", "location": "Novosibirsk, Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia", "id": "214af98f-1f67-5d36-91ed-8670d5711368", "time": "2024-03-29 15:33:56", "original": "After the previous publication of the Cheka-OGPU, it became clear that there were much more victims of the raider \u201cBelotserkovsky group\u201d in Novosibirsk than was previously known. Moreover, even Sberbank was on the list of victims! Which, of course, raises questions: how could such an organized group of raiders kill the country\u2019s industrial potential with impunity for many years? Law enforcement agencies already know the answer to this, but we will give a little more information about these people.\n\nThe informal leader of the group of raiders can be considered Anna Belotserkovskaya, a seemingly modest arbitration manager. However, the number of businessmen affected by her actions has already exceeded several dozen. Today it has even created an industry-specific SRO Guarantor, registered at par - in order to be able to bankrupt the \u201cnecessary\u201d companies without interference. Anna's supervisory cover is her mother (ex-judge of the Kalininsky District Court of Novosibirsk), aunt (current judge), as well as her father, who is an active employee of the Prosecutor General's Office. Information about liquid assets is provided by one of Belotserkovskaya\u2019s cohabitants, an employee of Trust Bank, Kirill Pokramovich. All members of the group own the classic raider set - luxury cars, property and real estate, which in no way correspond to their official income. For example, Belotserkovskaya\u2019s mother owns an elite cottage worth more than 50 million rubles, and also lives in Sochi in real estate worth more than 500 million.\n\nThe standard raiding scheme of the \u201cBelotserkovsky group\u201d is simple. With the participation of employees of the Federal Tax Service, supervisory and law enforcement agencies (their names are also already known to investigators), they organize \u201clegal\u201d or forceful seizures of operating enterprises. And later they sell off or steal property from the bankruptcy estate - and equipment worth hundreds of millions of rubles can be sold for pennies, like scrap metal. The video shows one of these seizures in Novosibirsk, which Anna Belotserkovskaya (in yellow) personally supervised.\n\nIn the wave of arrests of raiders that began a few days ago throughout Russia, the Novosibirsk \u201cBelotserkovsky group\u201d will definitely take a leading place. But even after the liquidation of the raider group, the security forces still have to figure out who and why provided their \u201ccover\u201d for so many years.
