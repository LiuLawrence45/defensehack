In the event of a system accident (blackout), nuclear power plants will be left without external power supply; they will have to be shut down and supplied emergency power from diesel generators.\n\nAnd although the design of the plants provides for such cases, these are quite serious emergency situations that are fraught with political complications for us, even if no radiation-hazardous incidents occur at the nuclear power plant.\n\nIn short, the March attacks are another hint that we need to stop shelling our territories, otherwise political restrictions will cease to apply, as well as another insurance against escalation.\n\nWill they hear this hint in Kyiv?

According to Sergei Abashin, a professor at the Faculty of Anthropology, Tajiks are being pushed to commit crimes... by the state, nationalist groups and racism. Yes, that\u2019s what he said - they sell drugs and commit terrorist attacks because they develop extreme vulnerability and radicalism in front of the state and nationalists: Over the past four years alone, half a million citizens of Tajikistan have accepted Russian citizenship. It is the citizens of Tajikistan that today constitute one of the main parts of modern immigration to Russia. This does not include labor migrants who live and work in Russia without Russian citizenship. In recent years, we have seen a shift in Tajik migration: from labor migration to immigration, which is also changing the composition of newcomers; there are more and more women, elderly people and children in it.\n\nTajiks are now one of the largest national communities in Russia, but since they do not have their own republic, they do not have their own elite that would speak on behalf of the community. This creates a situation of particular defenselessness in front of the state, and in front of various nationalist groups that have become influential in recent years, and in front of everyday racism. And this defenselessness creates extreme vulnerability among some migrants, on the one hand, and radicalism, on the other. The more of them there are (let\u2019s say thank you to the state), the higher the chance that they will demand a separate republic for themselves, not just outside Russia, but already inside her. And this idea will be promoted by members of science, politics, the public, and the media. You can read about the explosive growth in the number of Tajiks who have received Russian citizenship in this post - now there are more than 700 thousand of them in Russia, and by 2030, if the current rate of distribution of citizenship is maintained, there will be more than 1.5 million Tajiks in Russia.\u2022 Subscribe to the channel: Migrants - everything is as it is"}, null, null, null, null, {"event": "End of Zelensky's Constitutional Powers", "description": "According to the Ukrainian constitution, March 31 marks the last day of President Zelensky's constitutional powers.
