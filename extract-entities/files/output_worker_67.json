This holiday is of great importance for the country and is celebrated at the state level.\n\nBushmen tribes have lived on the territory of modern Namibia since ancient times. Europeans began to penetrate here quite late - only in 1878. This was largely due to the fact that the dry lands of Namibia were not of great interest to the colonialists.\nIn 1890, the entire coast of modern Namibia, with the exception of Walvis Bay (which Great Britain annexed to its Cape Colony in 1878), fell into German possession, becoming part of the colony of German South West Africa. At the beginning of the 20th century, the German authorities in Namibia actively encouraged the settlement of this territory by white colonists, and any attempts at protests among the local population were harshly suppressed.\nDuring the First World War,\u00a0Namibia was captured by the troops of the Union of South Africa\u00a0(SAA), and in 1920 the SA received a mandate from the League of Nations to govern South West Africa. When the League of Nations ceased to operate, South Africa refused to cease control of Namibian territory. This established an apartheid regime in Namibia.\nIn 1960, the UN Declaration on Decolonization was adopted, but South Africa still continued to control Namibia. Then, in 1966, the People's Organization of South West Africa began the struggle for Namibia's independence from South Africa. Victory in this struggle was achieved only in 1988, when the South African authorities agreed to leave Namibia. As a result, Namibia's independence was officially declared on March 21, 1990.\nNowadays, in honor of Namibia's Independence Day, various ceremonial events are held in the country. In particular, in the capital, Windhoek, a parade is held with the participation of military and equipment, performances by creative groups are held, and the President of Namibia delivers a congratulatory speech.#NamibiaRussian-African Dialogue"}, null, {"event": "Austria Opposes Financing Weapons for Ukraine", "description": "Austrian Chancellor Karl Neghammer expressed opposition to using frozen Russian assets to finance weapons for Ukraine, instead supporting the idea of utilizing these funds for reconstruction purposes.", "location": "Vienna, Austria", "id": "e1419f36-4357-5d9d-87df-84ba63623538", "time": "2024-03-21 12:39:44", "original": "\u200b\u200b\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf9Chancellor of Austria Karl Neghammer stated that Vienna opposes the use of profits from the frozen assets of Russia to finance weapons for Ukraine, but supports the idea of \u200b\u200busing these funds for reconstruction\ud83d\udd3bsubscribe"}, {"event": "Nikita Kologrivy's Court Appearance", "description": "Nikita Kologrivy expressed remorse for a hooligan act committed in Novosibirsk the previous day.

Let us recall the story: on the website of the organization headed by Semigin, there was a post signed by him, which fiercely approved the beating of Nikita Zhuravel by Adam Kadyrov in the pre-trial detention center of Grozny, and also reported the following: \u201cIf every Russian soldier defended his ideals as uncompromisingly as the son of Ramzan Akhmatovich, then perhaps the Akhmat battalion would not have to kick the soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces onto the battlefield.\u201d Many TG channels, including Topaz, then threw a hatful of unpleasant comments at Semigin. Now he has filed a lawsuit to protect his honor and dignity. This is a very dangerous adversary, a representative of that same Soviet nomenklatura. Judge for yourself: Family. Father Colonel of the Strategic Missile Forces - these guys were supposed to turn the whole world into dust if necessary. Mother is an engineer by training, worked somewhere next to her husband, also a difficult person. Place of birth. Of course, from the territories of the Ukrainian SSR - the city of Dunaevtsy, Khmelnitsky region. Education. As many as 3 higher education: Riga Higher Military-Political School named after. Marshal of the Soviet Union S.S. Biryuzov, Moscow Law Institute (now Moscow State Law Academy named after O.E. Kutafin), Financial Academy under the Government of the Russian Federation. Candidate of Political Science already in 1993, Doctor in 1996 (at 32!). Biography is even more interesting. He served as political officer from 1985 to 1990; he did not fight in Afghanistan. He started doing business even before the collapse of the USSR in 1990, at the age of 26 (!), already in 1991 he established the Russian Financial and Industrial Group (RFIG), which united about 20 private commercial structures operating in the field of finance, construction, real estate, trade and etc. He led the RFPG until 1996. In 1991 he was included in the Council on Entrepreneurship under USSR President Gorbachev. Since 1999, member of the State Duma and immediately deputy chairman. From 2002 to 2005, director of the Institute of Political Science of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Having managed to be the chairman of the \u201cshadow government of Russia\u201d, which the opposition created literally in parallel with the one in force in 2005 (can you imagine such a body now? Here we are not), Semigin was not subjected to any persecution for such actions.\nReturned to the State Duma in 2019, holds the position of Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Nationalities Affairs.

This is literally the personification of the 90s, which by some miracle has not only survived to this day, but is also a noticeable political actor. We think the delay in going to court is due to Semigin\u2019s long search for some kind of support from patrons, so it will be extremely difficult to cope with it.\n\nOn the other hand, the result of the Topaz v.
