Hello, dear readers of the channel. The other day we worked with a contingent with whom I have not worked for about 10 years. And, what\u2019s most interesting, nothing has changed in 10 years. Let's talk about this. Conscript.\nHere I am, an officer who once left the soldiers for the professional league and, by the will of fate, after many years, teaching them again. These 19-year-old boys are standing and looking at me. I don\u2019t know what they told them about me, but they don\u2019t make noise, but silently peer. Well, it's time to make men out of boys. We take on the preparation of conscripts.\n\nAfter the first day, the surprise of the young people knew no bounds. It turns out that you can serve in the army, just like in commercials. Many of the young soldiers, during breaks between classes, came up and thanked us for showing them how they can and should serve their Motherland. And from the height of my life\u2019s journey I cannot understand how one can serve differently...\n\nThese young people are like plasticine. How you train him now is how he will be later. If from the first days of his life in the army you show him what combat training is, take a lot of care and show little pity, then these puppies will grow up to be real wolfhounds. He is 19, he is young and does not realize all the risks, his body recovers faster from injuries and stress. This young man is most often ready to absorb new information, especially when he wants from the army what is shown in advertising. Command staff. But the commanders of these young men have much less faith in their guys than I, the instructor, who is investing in them here and now science to win. They think these guys are only made for sweeping, cleaning and other boring army activities. And these same commanders then offer these young men a contract. How is it that you want, comrade commanders, to turn a conscript-provider into a contract wolfhound within one day after signing a contract? There are no miracles. If you want to get yourself a contract specialist, start teaching him military skills during the \u201cemergency\u201d period. Otherwise, don\u2019t expect that these guys will be capable of anything. If you suffer for a long time, something will work out. But we just suffered for a week, and what happened was not something, but well-coordinated squads in an entire infantry company under the leadership of young contract sergeants. During the training, the boys enjoyed it so much that they tried very hard, sometimes we were even a little worried that while working on the training questions they would not injure themselves... And you, mothers, do not be afraid for your children. They are 19-20, already adults. If they need your help, they will let you know, but don't run after them. Give them independence. Bottom line: Conscripts are not downtrodden children. These are puppies that can be turned into dogs of war. It depends on how you treat them and how to train them. Commander, don\u2019t fuck these kids up, it was their peers who drove thirty-year-old bearded men through the mountains of Afghanistan and Chechnya. Why are they worse now?

The point is that our association is not trying to \u201creverse\u201d the objective historical processes of the formation of polycentricity.\nOn the contrary, BRICS strives to facilitate them in every possible way and lead them, but to do this not in its own narrow selfish interests, but in the interests of all its (and not only its) members, but also of all countries that want to interact with BRICS.\n\u2022 Our cooperation is based on an equal dialogue, respect for each country\u2019s choice of its own path of development, consideration of each other\u2019s interests and a focus on a collective search for solutions to all problems of our time.
