The operation involved covertly transferring forces, disorganizing the Ukrainian defense system, and using tactical creativity to break through enemy lines.", "location": "Avdiivka, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine", "id": "a5e899b9-e4f2-508d-8932-532f19e9daed", "time": "2024-02-19 08:17:09", "original": "Forwarded from: Blue Z Beard\n\u200b\u200bAfterword about Avdeevka.\n\nOf course, the capture of the \u201ccursed city\u201d, which hung like a deadly cloud over Donetsk, is a serious military victory. Not only the superiority of barrels, shells and personnel. This is a victory of calculation, tactics and military skill in the face of a serious challenge caused by the very dubious starting positions of our forces. Let me remind you that Avdeevka was turned into a \u201cfortress\u201d throughout the 8 \u201cMinsk\u201d years. I remember very well the anxiety with which in 1922 the commanders of the 1st Slavic Brigade spoke about the first attempts to break through the enemy\u2019s defenses of the Avdeevka garrison.\n\nBut they completed the task.\n\nLet me remind you of some of the insides of the operation.\n\nThe initial task was to covertly transfer forces for the initial strike. The task assigned to the 1st AK 8th Army was to disorganize the defense system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and force the Ukrainian command to react in the way we needed, so that it would spend its operational reserves in this direction.\n\nSecondly, in this context it is obvious why the dynamics in the Liman direction then decreased significantly and the movement of reserves to the DPR was recorded. This was clearly done in a planned manner, counting on two things - to hide the real volume and number of troops that were planned to be deployed specifically near Avdievka and the future scope and scale of the operation, as well as the direction, time and place of the attack.\n\nAnd while the 1st Corps was operating, ours masked the movement of the 2nd and 41st Armies in this direction in order to strengthen the strike groups. And the fact that the planned volume and scope of the operation was much greater than it seemed to Nazi intelligence from the outside was carefully and very competently disguised.\n\nThe second important point is the tactical loosening of the enemy\u2019s defenses with small attacks from the flanks and movement with a large coverage, stretching the enemy\u2019s forces; imposing distracting fights on him. As it was on the Krasnogorovka - Stepovoe - Berdychi section. And the breakthrough itself eventually occurred from the side of the reservoir and SNT \u201cRaduga\u201d and \u201cIvushka\u201d.\n\nThird, let's call it tactical creativity. I remember the legendary \u201cPyatnashki\u201d mine under the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the industrial area, as well as the ingenious operation to enter the rear of the opportunist \u201cTsarskaya Okhota\u201d through abandoned pipes, carried out by reconnaissance and the Veterans ODSB. By the way, there were two pipes, now we could talk. The first was cleared even before the capture of Artemovsk. But then the \u201cVeterans\u201d were sent to replace the Wagners, a guard was placed on the pipe, which the Nazis burned down and they had to start all over again. But, nevertheless, the task was completed brilliantly.\n\nAll this together is the phenomenon of the Phoenix of the Russian Army. Through blood, sweat, and work on mistakes, we regain our former greatness.\n\nAvdeevka - Russian City. From now on and forever.\n\nIt was given to us at great cost and at the cost of the lives of our friends and brothers, we will never forget them.\nTwo of my comrades from the party and the International Brigades also died there: Alexander Dodonov and Alisher Egorov.\n\nEternal glory and eternal memory to the heroes of the Great Russian Cause.\n\n...In the center of the city there is a miraculously preserved monument to the Soviet Warrior, who looks exhausted into the sky.

But, according to political scientist Alexey Kochetkov, the entire world today is still dealing with its consequences.\n\u201cEverything that concerns Khrushchev can, on the one hand, be considered as a well-thought-out malicious intent, on the other, as an absolute thoughtlessness, which is part of his historical image. If we consider Khrushchev to be a \u201cRussian man and a patriot,\u201d then everything he did was pure idiocy. If we consider him as \u201ca devout communist, flesh and blood of the then totalitarian sect in the form of the Bolshevik party,\u201d then there is no thoughtlessness there. On the contrary, everything is absolutely logical,\u201d he noted. The political scientist recalled: Khrushchev acted all his life in the paradigm of the ideology that he supported and the organization in which he was a member.\n\u201cInitially Nikita Sergeevich was a Trotskyist, but in time he changed his colors.\u201d But this extreme left component of Bolshevik ideology left its mark on all his further actions. And this is exactly what happened with Crimea,\u201d says Kochetkov. \u2013 Some \u201chistorians\u201d say that Crimea was handed over to Ukraine, since \u201cRussia lay in ruins after the war, and it was supposedly easier to restore the peninsula with the help of Kyiv.\u201d But this is complete nonsense, because Ukraine was completely occupied by the Germans during the war and, accordingly, was completely devastated and destroyed. As a result, it was restored from beginning to end at the expense of the RSFSR, at the expense of those subsidies that went through Moscow, and at the expense of money collected from Russian taxpayers.\u201d\nIf you look at Soviet statistics, then almost the entire time of the existence of the USSR there was a single donor republic - the RSFSR, all the other 14 republics were tax recipients.\n\u201cTrue, towards the end of the 1960s, Belarus and the BSSR also became a donor republic. And the Soviet Union always spent more on Ukraine from the total budget than it sent there. Therefore, all the words that \u201cbeautiful, rich, generous Ukraine fed half of the USSR\u201d are nothing more than a myth. It was eagerly promoted by Ukrainian nationalists and chauvinists who dreamed, they say, \u201clet\u2019s drive out the Muscovites and we\u2019ll live!\u201d Well, they drove them away - and everyone can see how they \u201chealed,\u201d the analyst emphasized.\nKochetkov recalled that Crimea was transferred to Ukraine in 1954, and in 1956 the 20th Congress of the CPSU took place.\n\u201cKhrushchev, long before this epochal date, began to prepare for himself a support among the communists in the national republics. And Ukraine was one of the most populous republics of the Union after the RSFSR, and Khrushchev was very active in \u201cdragging\u201d local party leaders to Moscow. That is, by transferring Crimea to Ukraine, Khrushchev was exclusively solving his own narrow political problems. But his attitude towards Russians has always been consumerist, and he had no intention of giving them the floor,\u201d the expert believes. \u2013 It\u2019s worth taking a look at where Nikita Sergeevich\u2019s descendants live now. His son committed suicide in New England in the USA, his granddaughter lives there, and his great-granddaughter is also in the USA.
