We are talking about a video performance at the St. Petersburg Jagger club in October 2023 - judging by the description, it was this that was subjected to examination.\n\nThe track became part of an absentee dispute between Beglov and Shnurov due to poor snow removal in the winter of 2021/2022.

He was a monarchist and critic of Marxism, who was exiled from Russia and later persecuted by the Nazis. His works influenced modern conservatism and Russian nationalism, advocating for national solidarity and the monarchical idea.", "location": "Moscow, Russia", "id": "7bca4a79-0de5-5425-addb-e64ef3781aff", "time": "2024-04-09 16:57:16", "original": "Putin's favorite philosopher. Ivan Ilyin was bornToday is the birthday of the important Russian philosopher Ivan Ilyin. Modern readers, as a rule, know very little about Ilyin. The best case scenario is that Ilyin is Putin\u2019s favorite philosopher. At worst - that he is a \u201csupporter of Hitler and the Nazis.\u201d\nWho really was the Russian philosopher Ilyin and what did he stand for? \"Ordinary Tsarism\" tells the story. Extremely brief and strictly to the point.\n\nIlyin was born into a noble family. His father served as a lawyer for the Moscow Court Chamber, and also held elected positions in the local government of the Ryazan province.\n\nAfter graduating from high school with honors, Ivan entered the law faculty of Moscow University to continue his father\u2019s work. But during his studies he became interested in philosophy. In his youth, Ilyin, like many of his peers, was infected with revolutionary ideology, but when he came face to face with the leftist environment, he very quickly revised his views and became a convinced monarchist.\n\nThe student's intelligence was noted by the university authorities, who recommended that he stay to continue his scientific work. Even then, he became one of the first and most consistent critics of Marxism from a deeply scientific point of view. When Lenin\u2019s helpless work \u201cMaterialism and Empirio-Criticism\u201d was published in 1909, Ilyin responded with a devastating review that demonstrated the intellectual inferiority of the Bolshevik leader.\n\nIlyin noticed that Lenin in his work resorted to a polemical technique that is still popular today. Explaining the views of his opponents, Lenin consciously simplifies and elaborates them, after which he refutes what he himself came up with. Lenin\u2019s trademark style of political boor did not go unnoticed. \u201cThe literary swagger here sometimes reaches the pillars of Hercules and sometimes turns into a direct mockery of the elementary requirements of decency,\u201d wrote Ilyin.\n\nIt is not difficult to understand with what feeling the philosopher greeted the Bolshevik revolution. He did not hide his views and openly spoke out against the new authorities. Already in the spring of 1918, Ilyin was arrested. But the popular professor at the university was released at the request of students and teachers. By 1922, Ilyin had been imprisoned six times, the last arrest threatened death - the philosopher had already been sentenced to death.\n\nBy that time, the number of sentenced Russian intellectuals with world renown already reached hundreds. The authorities decided that it would be more beneficial for the image of the Reds not to execute, but to exile the flower of the Russian intelligentsia on the later famous \u201cPhilosophical Steamer\u201d. Ilyin was also among those expelled. He continued his activities within the walls of the Russian Scientific Institute in Berlin.\n\nAfter the Nazis came to power, Ilyin was again subjected to persecution and repression. Already in 1934, he lost his job, and in 1938, pursued by the Gestapo, he fled from Germany to Switzerland, where he lived until the end of his life. Today's communists slander Ilyin, declaring him a \u201cNazi supporter.\u201d But think about how you can make such accusations against a scientist, one of whose program articles was literally called \u201cGermany is the main national enemy of Russia.\u201d\n\nSo what did Ilyin really stand for? His works had a huge influence on the formation of the ideas of modern conservatism and Russian nationalism. Ilyin consistently adhered to Orthodox Christianity, and was one of the first to put forward the concept of the \u201cthird way\u201d - an alternative to both capitalism and communism. Ilyin believed that the basis of society should be the idea of national solidarity. The philosopher called patriotism the most natural way to unite people.\n\nIlyin directly wrote that Russia should have two foundations: uncompromising Russian nationalism and the monarchical idea. We don\u2019t know for sure how much Vladimir Putin\u2019s favorite philosopher Ilyin is. But it would be very nice for him to become one.

When we were returning, we saw this shell - it was lying on the side of the road, - said a military medic, on whose helmet there is a USSR flag.\n\nAn amazing coincidence: a medical orderly took his call sign after the surname of a character from a famous detective.
